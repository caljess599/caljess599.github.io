          <p>The body has a way of dealing with food-borne illness: ejecting the contaminant via all possible means. This process can be unpleasant, even horrid. But it works.</p>

<p>The mind, perhaps, works differently. It can be much more difficult to recognize the symptoms of a ‘mental food’ illness than a physical one. We dine on media much the way we dine on food—mostly driven by habit. And habits are hard to break.</p>

<p>But they can be broken. Often what happens is that we hit some sort of bottom, which in turn provokes a crisis—literally, a turning point. A few weeks ago, I experienced precisely this. I realized that with every piece of news I consumed, I only felt more enraged and more powerless. And I also realized that I was choosing this experience; no one was putting a gun to my head and telling me ‘read/listen to/watch this news or else’.</p>

<p>So I decided to stop. And as with the stomach flu or a severe hangover, I felt better—much better—within 48 hours. So good, in fact, that I decided to keep on rationing my news consumption. Here’s what I've learned.</p>

<p><em>Silence is the perfect antidote to powerlessness.</em> Silence is a reclaiming of one’s own mental space. It says to all the forces that would impinge on it: “no, you cannot have it, it is mine.” It is in silence that we can truly decide, rather than have whatever voices are around us at that moment decide for us. And making conscious decisions—even if they are small as what to turn on or do for the next hour—is the key to feeling powerful as opposed to overwhelmed.</p>

<p><em>Attention is too valuable a resource to squander absent-mindedly.</em> There is too much media to consume, period. You will never consume it all. So stop trying. Instead, focus on how what you do consume makes you feel. Several months ago, I began to notice that much of the reading I did of the news online did not actually add anything to my life: it did not broaden my knowledge, or change my perspective, or even brighten my day. Mostly, it did just the opposite. I began to ask myself: why am I bothering? Now I take the time I used to spend mindlessly reading the daily newspaper and spend it reading longer-form pieces that <em>do</em> broaden my knowledge, change my perspective, and sometimes even brighten my day. In fact, the less time I spend consuming media that does not have that effect, the more enjoyable the other stuff becomes.</p>

<p><em>All affirmative action starts with genuine awareness.</em> Attention is limited, and must be rationed, but awareness can be nearly infinitely deepened. You can be very aware, and very well informed, without paying constant attention. You can put your phone down and still be a functioning, respected member of society. But this is a conclusion we will have to reach <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/opinion/sunday/resist-the-internet.html">in spite of our digital devices</a>. The companies that design apps and media companies that depend on advertising for revenue will never tell us so; their business model relies on the falsehood that more is always better—simply because <em>more is better for them.</em> </p>

<p><em>Consumption is not the enemy; unconscious consumption is.</em> It has been said that the reason dieting is so difficult is that, unlike, say, alcohol, you cannot just altogether quit eating. The same can be said for media consumption. Indeed, I am never going to stop reading, nor am I going to forswear the occasional, glorious binge watch. And just like with food, we are always going to be in an environment full of media, an awful lot of it put there by someone else with the goal of making a buck off you. This should make you skeptical, but more than that, it should make you realize how much power you have in your choice. Become a media 'gourmet' by seeking higher-quality fare and by pushing away your plate when you have had had your daily (or weekly) fill. Support newspapers and magazines whose journalism you value by subscribing, after which you can feel free to only consume as much as fits within your media diet. You can leave articles 'on your plate' so to speak.</p>

<p><em>We are not the media. We get to turn our backs!</em> Ever since L’Innominato’s press conference last month, I have had this wonderful fantasy that, at some point, all journalists and reporters would just declare “a day without T—.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/opinion/an-issue-without-trump.html">As the New York Times did</a>.) No reporting, no analysis, not even a mention of a single tweet. If he held a press conference, the press corps would stand there and simply turn their backs. But this is a fantasy precisely because the media is employed to engage no matter what. Quite literally, their livelihoods depend on it. Instead of waiting for them to turn their backs, we can simply turn off the tv/radio/app. We have a right—and a duty to ourselves—to honor the feeling that enough is enough.</p>

          <p>I’ve felt sick since November 8th, but sickest of all this week, hoping (in vain) for some sort of <em>deus ex machina</em> to prevent the final conjoining of the words “President of the US” and “Donald Trump”. And yet, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/divided-states-of-america">it has been a long time coming</a>. The whole time “we” were feeling astounded, wonderful, or just merely content that Obama was President, Trumpism was brewing.</p>

<p>As terrified as I am, I have come to several conclusions about the outcome of this election that give me some measure of consolation:</p>

<p><em>Trump being elected doesn’t define America.</em> Yes, this election will have consequences, possibly terrible ones, but Trump’s election hasn’t changed who we are as individuals. We remain the same people we were before November 8th, and so we are as free as we were then to think and act. We do not have to ever consider Trump a legitimate, qualified, or decent holder of the Office of the President. I know I never will.</p>

<p><em>There is a strategic silver lining in Hillary Clinton’s defeat.</em> If Hillary Rodham were being inaugurated tomorrow morning, I’d be taking the day off in celebration. And I’m sad about that. I’m sad for her, I’m sad for women, and I’m sad for our country. But her tenure would have surely been marked by the same level (or worse) of obstructionism from the Republicans and rage from those people who flocked to Trump rallies. As it stands now, the right gets a chance to satisfy the demands of its base. The reaction to their attempt has a far better chance of transforming the GOP than four or eight more years of a Democratic President. After all, it didn't work during eight years of Obama.</p>

<p><em>Our fear should motivate us to get involved in local government.</em> The striking thing (to me, anyway) is that the parties of both constituencies appear to believe that the solution to all America’s problems reside in national laws and policies. <em>If only we could get the right people in power</em>, the thinking goes, <em>everything can be fixed!</em> The passive voice in that last phrase is purposeful: what we are hoping for is not just salvational change, but the permission to check out until the next election. Democrats now have a lot of very powerful reasons not to do that. And I am convinced that local action is the key to all political renewal. Voting is wonderful, <em>but it is not enough</em>.</p>

<h3 id="castles-in-the-sky">Castles in the Sky</h3>
<p>Recently, I had a chance to visit one only two remaining Baroque theaters in the world; apparently, remodeling and/or fire have destroyed the rest. The one I visited is in the tiny Southern Bohemian city of Český Krumlov, part of the immense castle complex first constructed before 1250. Over the course many owners, the castle was expanded and refurbished: most notably, it was the Rosenberg family who, over the course of three centuries (1302-1602), expanded and beautified the castle, including the expansion and painting of the characteristic tower in the 1581 and 1590 respectively.</p>

<p>The Baroque theater dates from much later owners; from 1765-1766, Josef Adam zu Schwarzenberg remodeled the existing theater building (built nearly 100 years prior) and transformed it into a state-of-the-art facility for the staging of Baroque operas. The period embraced excess and ornamentation to a combination and degree perhaps not seen since; in opera, this translated to lengthy spectacles in which no effort was spared to manufacture—through the use of complex stage mechanisms (trap doors, flying machines, instant before-your-eyes scene changes) and sound effects, in addition to the music itself—an ideal environment for the spectator to succumb to the illusion of the drama.</p>

<p>For twenty years, Josef Adam brought a troupe of actors, musicians and their trappings to mount a summer season of operas and plays for the entertainment of the palace dwellers and their guests. (The theater was not heated, so could not be used in the winter.) But his son didn’t share the father’s interest in theater, and so the theater (and the adjoining building where the sets, costumes, props and scores were kept) was simply shut up and forgotten about. It sat there, safe but ignored, slowly rotting away, until the mid-1960s, when excavation and restoration of this unique place began. Today, you can sit in the orchestra and look at the restored theater in low lights as well as visit the area underneath the stage where the beams and ropes that made the magic happen—and still do so during the limited season of operatic performances the theater hosts. The only concessions to modernization have been in the use of electric lighting in the theater itself (although the orchestra pit still uses candles during performances) and the installation of a tile floor under the stage—before it was merely dirt. Eventually, depending on the progress of restoration (which itself depends on money), the repository of costumes, props, sets and documentation will also be fully restored and opened to the public as a museum.</p>

<p>From the point of view of preserving history, the benign neglect of this theater has proven to be a tremendous gift. But as its rarity testifies, historically there was little interest in preserving products of cultural ephemera, including opera. Although it may come as a surprise to some, students of opera know that the concept of a repertory in which the works of the past were preserved and revived is shockingly recent. This is why we have many, many librettos from the 17th and 18th and even the 19th century without scores—the librettos were suitable for reuse, while the music was considered disposable. While analog and now ubiquitous digital recording have taken the notion of preservability to the opposite extreme (we are more likely to worry about how to preserve it than the value of doing so, which is almost taken for granted), the Lesson of the Rare Baroque Theater pinpoints rather elegantly the orthogonal relationship between art making and keeping art: there may be old and new for the maker, but it is only history that confers upon the past the notion of ‘authenticity’. To repeat, it is not a matter of whether the past is acknowledged, for no artists works in a vacuum of the present. Rather, the difference is the way in which the past is acknowledged: incorporation versus isolation, evolution versus preservation. Put plainly, it is the difference between a theater and a Baroque theater.</p>

<p>As rare a site as the theater is, it did not appear to be a top tourist destination at the Český Krumlov Castle. (There were maybe eight people on our English-speaking tour.) The tower, on the other hand, had plenty of visitors, despite the fact that the neatest thing about the beautiful structure painted to look like a multi-colored extravaganza of sculpted stone is not to be <em>in</em> it but to look <em>at</em> it from further away. If this view in previous centuries served as a kind of billboard for the Rosenberg family’s power, now the onlooker is more likely to appreciate the construction itself, perhaps without even pausing to consider that the many artisans who designed and built it were responsible not to beauty but to the demands of their employers. Or perhaps it is precisely this fortuitous outcome between the expression of wealth and that of beauty that makes this quaint town, completely modernized in every other respect, worthy of its place on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites. Surely it is not the power dynamics that are strange to us, as the industries that exist to fulfill the unique needs of the rich continue to thrive, but rather the fact that beauty visible to all used to be the (occasional) result of these whims.</p>

<h3 id="crossings">Crossings</h3>
<p>Apparently we got lucky on our trek between Germany and the Czech Republic (which also took us through a slice of Austria on the way back), as we were later informed that each country requires visiting cars to purchase a unique highway sticker that allows you to travel its high speed roads. One might forgive a traveler without good (or any, in the case of Czech) knowledge of the native language for thinking that the days of such border-based worries were over; the only person to welcome us to the Czech Republic when we crossed the border was our English-speaking GPS.</p>

<p>As any student of history knows, however, the borderlands between Southern Bohemia and Upper Austria saw a great deal of conflict in the last century. As an outsider visiting in the age of the EU, driving almost without awareness over national borders, staring at the rolling fields of farmland on all sides, you are hard-pressed to roll back the clock to the Cold War and the hot one before it; it was over these lands that Hitler ordered his armies while the world stood by, still clinging to the vain hope of appeasement.</p>

<p>Conceiving of the region that spans Southern Bohemia and Upper Austria as a unified space, despite multiple languages and national territories, is one way that enlightened folks have been striving to find aspects that united rather than divide the region’s inhabitants. While we were in Český Krumlov, the former synagogue (itself used as a chapel for the liberating GIs at the end of the war) hosted an exhibit that formed part of the first ever “Landesausstellung,” (Land Exhibition), a venture of exhibits in four towns in this region, two in Upper Austria and two in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>Late one night in Český Krumlov, I read about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/us/garry-davis-man-of-no-nation-dies-at-91.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">death of Garry Davis</a>, a man who in 1948 renounced his United States citizenship in order to declare himself a citizen of the world. While the notion of World Government almost inevitably sounds dystopic to our cynical ears, Davis viewed global unity as essential not for what it could create, but for what it could dissolve: nation-states, and with them, all need for war. Whether utopian or quixotic—the press and public were divided—Davis was certainly committed, and spent half a century traveling with the first passport (no. 1) issued by the organization he founded, the World Government of World Citizens, sometimes charming or wearing down foreign passport authorities, but very often being detained and deported. (Somehow or other, though, he was able to settle down in his later years in Vermont.)</p>

<p>The inspiration of this odd life came in a B-17 bomber over Germany, where Davis’s conscience asked him if there were another way besides the “murder” of “men, women and children” in which he was participating. It is not surprising that in the context of such a nationalist, territory-focused conflict that this other way would be the elimination of these very bodies. While shaky as a political strategy, as a formulation of the human right not to be blown to bits while going about your daily business, it is a clarion call. After all, the reason Davis was in that plane, and the reason he was dropping bombs, was because he was “American” and they were “German,” and the two countries were enemies. In Davis’s mind, the elimination of this difference went to the heart of eliminating the possibility for such large-scale conflict, and the suffering and destruction it brought.</p>

<h3 id="wanderers">Wanderers</h3>
<p>While the threat of total war waged by an expansionist regime is seldom on anyone’s mind today, Davis’s insistence on the inalienable right of anyone to travel anywhere is a topic as timely as they come: while Julian Assange and Edward J. Snowden choose first-world-style vagabondage to avoid facing the music in their respective home states, the coffins keep filling this week on the Italian island of Lampedusa as divers recover more bodies belonging to the men, women and even children who were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24418779">shipwrecked in their attempt to reach European soil</a> last week. As the influx of immigrants (both legal and illegal) continues, nationalist political parties in many European countries incite followers with racist, anti-immigration rhetoric—and all this at the same time when some political theorists believe that the only way for Europe to survive (economically but also politically) is to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/opinion/the-fix-for-europe-people-power.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">acknowledge the increasing irrelevance of its internal nation-state borders</a>.</p>

<p>While the elimination of frequent passport controls and currencies exchanges have changed the flavor of multi-country European travel, and while globalization has made the selection of shops far more uniform (think H&amp;M and Starbucks) than ever before, these changes, in my experience anyway, only seem to highlight the remaining unique features of each country: language, architecture, customs, cuisine. In an age of instant, cheap, and frequent communications, there is something downright magical about arriving at another latitude and longitude and finding oneself, in the midst of an ever-increasingly linked infrastructure, in a space colored by a different language and culture.</p>

<p>It is easy to become cynical about the level of uniformity among people on the street, wearing the products of the global clothing trade and staring into the same smart phones. But we have to ask ourselves if we were really convinced that national borders really made people fundamentally different from one another, and if the similarities wrought by today’s particular consumerism aren’t just the form in which the revelation of our fundamental human sameness takes in this age (religion no longer serving this purpose, although the churches remain). We might bear in mind that unity, whether understood in the context of peacenik pluralism of Garry Davis or the perverted purity of neo-Nazism and other fundamentalist movements (political and religious), has always been and remains a seductive promise for crusaders of all stripes.</p>

<p>Whatever the anxieties, individual and collective, about the changing face of Europe, the ball is rolling downhill. Europe, through legal immigration, has already significantly loosened the ties, imaginative and legal, between ‘nationality’ and ‘country of birth’. This idea that you can be say, German, even if your parents are from Pakistan, is a concept taken for granted in America, but one that has just begun to take hold in the European cultural imagination. But the tide has turned in a way from which there is no turning back, given declining birthrates, the demand for labor from abroad, and non-isolationist policies fundamental to the ideals of Western democracies.</p>

<p>Countries, as living products of human culture, are like theaters; they evolve to survive. To fixate on an idea of Europe, or of static, inviolable individual nationalities within its borders, is to pretend that a country can be like the Baroque Theater in Český Krumlov: a relic of a place popular for a brief while and then abandoned, now admired by a mere handful of visitors and scholars for its historical value and ‘authenticity’.</p>

<p>From the looks of things, closing Europe for business and reopening as a museum doesn’t seem likely. You can admire the past all you want, but you can’t live in it.</p>

<h3 id="stuck-in-the-middle-world">Stuck in the Middle World</h3>
<p>In <em>The God Delusion</em>, Richard Dawkins’s latest book decrying the absurdities of religion and denying the existence of God, the author uses the term ‘Middle World’ to describe the world within a human-scale frame of reference. By middle, Dawkins means to indicate that our brains have developed in response to objects that are neither very small (microorganisms) or very big (astral bodies), but that are in the middle (trees, elephants, mice, grain). While we may understand through science the true nature of matter—namely that it is mostly emptiness—this is not the way our brains have evolved to think naturally.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the way we see the world, and the reason why we find some things intuitively easy to grasp and others hard, is that our brains are themselves evolved organs: on-board computers, evolved to help us survive in a world—I shall use the name Middle World—where the objects that mattered to our survival were neither very large nor very small; a world where things either stood still or moved slowly compared with the speed of light; and where the very improbable could safely be treated as impossible. Our mental burka window is narrow because it didn’t <em>need</em> to be any wider in order to assist our ancestors to survive. (412)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dawkins adopts the image of the burka-draped Muslim woman as an illustrative metaphor for this partial understanding, purposefully appropriating a religious image he associates with extremism and limitation (indeed, oppression). He does this not only to emphasize that all humans share the natural limitation of our evolved eyesight and, in correlation — at least until the advent of the scientific method—our limited mental understanding of the invisible workings of the physical world, but also, of course, to stress that the natural step for human beings is to push our understanding beyond this narrow window. Religion for Dawkins represents at best a refusal to understand the world as science reveals it and at worst the subjection of others to oppressions that are falsely justified by irrational dogmas.</p>

SECTION 1
(a) The findings indicate that:
(1) substantial medical evidence recognizes that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by not later than 20 weeks after fertilization;
(2) the state has a compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that these children are capable of feeling pain;
(3) the compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that an unborn child is capable of feeling pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither state interest is intended to replace the other; and
(4) restricting elective abortions at or later than 20 weeks post-fertilization, as provided by this Act, does not impose an undue burden or a substantial obstacle on a woman’s ability to have an abortion because:
(A) the woman has adequate time to decide whether to have an abortion in the first 20 weeks after fertilization; and
(B) this Act does not apply to abortions that are necessary to avert the death or substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman or abortions that are performed on unborn children with severe fetal abnormalities.
(b) The legislature intends that every application of this statute to every individual woman shall be severable from each other. In the unexpected event that the application of this statute is found to impose an impermissible undue burden on any pregnant woman or group of pregnant women, the application of the statute to those women shall be severed from the remaining applications of the statute that do not impose an undue burden, and those remaining applications shall remain in force and unaffected, consistent with Section 10 of this Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although my readers may be forgiven for assuming so, I actually didn’t enjoy the (many) parts of <em>The God Delusion</em> where Dawkins ridicules religious extremists. Extremists of all sorts are ridiculous, or at least easily ridiculed, and to dismiss religion <em>in toto</em> based on the Westboro Baptist Church or the Taliban is like dismissing cooking based on restrictavors (am I coining a phrase?) and freegans. Naturally, it is one thing to have a meal ruined by a screaming vegan and another to be bomb-blasted at the Boston Marathon, so it follows that we are likely to be more collectively concerned with militant Islam than with militant foodies. But the threat of danger aside (not just violence but also the restriction of the rights associated with non-belief), it is not an interesting intellectual exercise to point out to crazed Biblical literalists the contradiction in terms between the protection of ‘innocent’ (unborn) lives and the murder of abortion doctors—or, for that matter, to point out the fact that the born-again Christian George W. Bush, as Governor of Texas, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/george-bush-executed-texans-at-faster-rate-than-rick-perry/">presided over the state-sanctioned execution of 152 people</a>.</p>

<p>Although Dawkins does not pursue this line of thinking, his analysis suggests a far more interesting line of inquiry in the context of the fanatical politicization of ‘life’ at its neo-natal and neo-mort stages. As the text of the new Texas law shows, these lawmakers (at least those who are not driven purely by craven political expediency) have begun to interpret their role as protectors of the public good from a standpoint skewed away from the typical political sphere of the Middle World—life outside of the home, among local residents—and toward the Micro World of zygotes and fetuses. Without the advances of science, we would have no way to see the very initial stages of life, and therefore no model in which to discuss its characteristics, including its ability to feel pain. For centuries, this invisibility meant that <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2005/06/the_consciometer.html">the quickening of the fetus</a>, i.e., its first clear movement, was considered threshold of conscious life, and thus the dividing line between legal and illegal abortions.</p>

<p>Of course, the decision to view the prevention of pain as a primary interest of the state is not a scientific question but a philosophical one. Certainly on the level of personal philosophy, the advancement of science is mixed up in there somewhere, given that along with the development of ever greater ways to manipulate and control our internal chemical environments has come the prevailing attitude that pain is the enemy and that a modern, civilized life—especially an American one—should be pain-free. But as a state interest, it does not suggest itself as an obvious candidate, especially given that the causes of pain in any given individual life are multiple and multifactorial, and thus can hardly all be prevented. (Are they to pass an Act for the Prevention of Skinned Knees in the next session?) Indeed, the majority of laws, state and national, do not have as their goal the mitigation of physical pain.</p>

<p>Thus we ought to see the pain of the unborn not as an instance of a general state interest in pain prevention, but rather a specific one: specific to both the pre-human <em>qua</em> pre-human, and also to the type of pain being experienced, i.e., the pain that interrupts the process of development. Put another way, the state interest in ‘pain prevention’ is unique to beings whose experience of this pain would be caused by termination. Once the threshold of fetal viability is crossed, as the statute itself makes clear, this pain argument ceases to matter, for the state’s interest in protecting those fetuses is not based on the sensation of pain but on their status as separate beings with certain individual rights. Indeed, for many staunch pro-lifers, their attitudes toward pain undergo a stunning reversal at the point of viability, as they argue that every life, no matter how compromised, is worth preserving and sustaining, even if the conditions involved are painful and require extensive, invasive—and arguably painful—medical interventions. (Even separate of the issue of selective abortions based on genetic testing, medical advances are provoking an increasingly difficult situation in regard to severely premature deliveries; while increasingly skillful interventions can save the lives more and more of these unfortunate infants, the question is begged regarding the long-term efficacy of costly procedures whose results are children with lifelong developmental hinderances.)</p>

<p>But to return to the main subject at hand, the pain of the pre-viable fetus is a pain that lacks self-consciousness, and therefore its context is not self-referential but is purely externalized—it is the projected moral agony of those who cherish a theoretical ideal of Life represented by the embryonic form. This is not to say that there is not a height to the moral ground on which the claim against abortion is made; indeed, there is a beautiful neatness to the idea of <em>letting something grow</em> that generally inspires awe. It <em>is</em> the course of nature for living things to grow, to multiply, and once one attaches the notion of the sacred to life, then it is a small step to the notion that life’s multiplication is sacred, too. And who doesn’t love babies? And on a philosophical level, the notion of <em>letting live</em> contains within it the strength and discipline of restraint; it is so noble an idea that it is easy to forget that an equal part of human life, of our evolution as beings on this planet, consists of manipulation and interference with the natural world. We cut down forests, we kill animals; we till, sow, weed, and harvest the fields; we mine metals; we pollute rivers; we develop drugs to kill cancerous cells; we terminate unwanted pregnancies.</p>

<h3 id="we-are-all-christians">We Are All Christians</h3>
<p>In 1954, the Italian writer Alberto Moravia wrote an essay on the topic of Kant’s categorical imperative in which he discussed how Christianity had exhausted itself, proving itself no longer capable of effectively rendering, through its conception of the sacred, man as an end rather than a means. The post-war political climate, as well as the atrocities of the Shoah, just barely in the rear-view mirror, provided for Moravia ample proof:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Christianity has made all men Christians without exception, and as it cannot make them more than Christians it no longer has any part to play. The men who in our own time, by aberrant experiments and destinies, are used as means to attain certain human ends, are in fact neither pagans nor Neanderthal men—they are Christians. And their executioners are Christians too. And with the fat of Christians exterminated by other Christians during the last war, soap was made; and with their ashes the fields of other Christians were fertilized. Hitler was every bit as much a Christian as the Pope and Roosevelt. A proof of this was that, though his reason or reasons of state allowed him to commit nothing but crimes, he never managed to delude himself entirely into thinking that these crimes were not crimes—which is why he took such care to conceal them and destroy their traces up to the last minute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth of all this is manifest both in the impotence of Christianity to save men a second time from slavery, and in the uneasiness that slavery arouses in us. In other words, we are Christians psychologically, but on the ethical plane—that is, on the operative plane—we are no longer Christians, precisely because we are Christians psychologically. […] The early Christians remained psychologically pagan for a long time, which was the reason and explanation of their acceptance of the Christian ethic. It took twenty centuries to make man psychologically Christian, hence depriving Christianity’s ethical function of authority.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We now find that we are faced not by one end only but by innumerable ones which, though perfectly rational, are all materialist and inhuman, and on all sides man is turned into a means to attain these ends. […] Christianity had the quality of setting man as an end and not making use of him to attain that end. (“Man As An End,” from <em>Man As An End: A Defense of Humanism</em>, 30-1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Moravia’s point is that Christianity has faded into the background to the extent that its precepts are ignorable to the point of global war and technologically-aided genocide, then my point, based on Dawkins’s observations, is that currently Christianity has gotten sucked into the Micro World to the point where it cannot see the forest from the trees; the religious right is so busy trying to protect the unborn that they have no will left to be concerned with the post-born, i.e., the living. They are so concerned with Life that they forget about life—and it is the one with the small letter that we are all living.</p>

<p>This is a common charge from the left, namely, that the right wants all children to be born, but does not want to use public money to feed, house, and educate them after they are born. Democrats, who are now basically defined by their whole-hog pro-choice stance, often defend their position based on this ‘facts-on-the-ground’ observation: why should we condemn a poor mother of four to bear another child she doesn’t want and can’t afford? It is pragmatism on an individual and a societal level, one that is often attacked by the right for being callous and self-serving, e.g., parents who don’t want a special-needs child are selfish; the promoters of abortion in American are perpetrating a genocide against African Americans.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that there used to be a strain of liberals who were pro-life. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/opinion/31douthat.html?_r=0">Eunice Kennedy</a> is a great example; guided by her staunch Roman Catholicism, she “saw a continuity, rather than a contradiction, between championing the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed and protecting unborn human life.” In 1992, she was a member of a number of pro-life Democrats who urged the Democratic National Convention to reconsider its abortion-on-demand position in its platform, proposing</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… a new understanding, one that does not pit mother against child. To establish justice and to promote the general welfare, America does not need the abortion license. What America needs are policies that responsibly protect and advance the interest of mothers <em>and</em> their children, both before <em>and</em> after birth. Such policies would provide maximum feasible legal protection for the unborn and maximum feasible care and support for pregnant women, mothers, and children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the eyes of these pro-life Democrats, the notion that abortion-on-demand was necessary for women’s social equality/advancement (and that conversely requiring them to bear unplanned children was a source of suffering) “reflects a terrible failure of moral imagination and social responsibility and an appalling lack of respect for women.” Although the text contains no mention of contraception, and only one vague reference to “family planning,” one might hopefully assume that part of a more imaginative social plan for women is not just more social and financial support for mothers but also free and ubiquitous access to birth control. This is of course a sticky issue for those Democrats who pro-life stance is motivated by religious principles, as the Roman Catholic Church is no more keen on contraception than it is on abortion.</p>

<p>To the extent that the political debate about abortion has been driven by religious principles, it remains a debate about sex, in particular the contexts in which women <em>should</em> be having sex. At its worse, the idea that a woman should not only expect but desire to become pregnant each time she has intercourse is a reduction of her body and mind to a biological vessel of procreation—and this religious view has been heartily and justifiably derided as the highest form of sexism. But that is not to say that there is not a measure of honor accorded to the woman in this view; certainly it is a high bar of respect for women if we were to suppose that each time a man had sex with a woman, he did it not merely for his pleasure, but out of love for the woman who might as a result of the act bear his child. On this highest level—even if we acknowledge that this scenario constitutes a fantasy of Edenic proportions—the issue we are discussing is a sexual respect for women. And that, my friends, is clearly a discussion we need to have most urgently.</p>

<p>The Internet is For—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Porn has evolved from the airbrushed misogyny of glossy spreads in Playbook and smutty films sold in seedy shops. It is corporate and easily available. Its products today focus less on sex between a man and woman and increasingly on groups of men beating off on a woman’s face or tearing her anus open with their penises. Porn has evolved to its logical conclusion. It first turned women into sexual commodities and then killed women as human beings. And it has won the culture war. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Why do deep down within we’d all like to be porn stars at one point in our life or another?” asks Faye Wattleton in complete earnestness on the HBO Special <em>Thinking XXX</em>. She is the president of the <em>[now defunct?]</em> <a href="http://www.nndb.com/org/186/000165688/">Center for the Advancement of Women</a> (86) —Chris Hedges, “The Illusion of Love,” <em>Empire of Illusion:
The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone is willing to say: pornography is everywhere. Almost no one is willing to say: and I have seen some of it. […] That squeamishness about detail isn’t merely a matter of sociological interest. It has real consequences. It means that the argument about pornography becomes binary: on or off, consensual or exploitative, arousing or repellent. And then, because most of us are instinctively opposed to censorship, we sigh that it’s a fact of life, and we just have to put up with all of it. […] [T]he really important debates about pornography should not be about legal principles, but ethical ones. Here’s where my â€“ oh, God, there’s no other word for it â€“ expertise comes in. I can tell you, for example, that if you’re interested in watching two people having sex (and see no moral problem in that interest) but not so interested in watching women being treated badly, your options are pretty limited. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few years ago, I interviewed <em>The Sun</em>’s agony aunt Deidre Sanders, who told me that the biggest change in the make-up of her postbag since she took up the role in 1980 was the precipitous growth in letters from men and women whose relationships had been affected by pornography. […] One study found that 90 per cent of content on the most popular porn sites featured physical or verbal abuse against women, and you don’t have to be <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/763998.stm">Mary Whitehouse</a> to find that concerning. We need to do something about it, and since we are not going to outlaw pornography altogether, we need to figure out what that might be. —Archie Bland, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-truth-about-pornography-its-time-for-a-rude-awakening-8735043.html">The Truth About Pornography: It’s Time for a Rude Awakening</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I really wanted to talk about in this post was what it means to hear men talk so boldly about porn, something liberals, feminists and the religious right seem to have given up on. Hedges’s in-depth and unflinching statement about the ubiquity and crassness of porn, and about either our selective ignorance, displacement, and denial of the truth of the matter is one thing—a brave thing!—but even more impressive is the company it keeps in his book. To talk about victory of pornography—specifically the significance of its violence against women (that cherished trump card of the anti-abortion movement!)—alongside the more recent phenomena of the triumph of celebrity on reality TV, the widening wealth gap in rich nations, and the foolish hucksterism of the new philosophy of happiness constitutes a type of New Critique particular to our present culture.</p>

<p>One of the aspects of this New Critique is to reject the idea that greater permissiveness is always a sign of cultural progress. To take this stand of course is to threaten one of my own sacred cows, that is, my conviction that the full recognition (and increasing acceptance) of gays and lesbians is one of the most significant and remarkable achievements of the last generation (within the places in the world it has occurred). Who am I to say that being gay is okay, but porn isn’t? Is there a credible basis on which to make the claim? For humanists, perhaps that would be the notion that violence is inherently immoral, even if its ‘victims’ are ‘willing’, and consensual love is another matter. Of course this will not convince the Bible thumpers, despite the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/world/europe/pope-francis-gay-priests.html?pagewanted=all">recent remarks of Pope Francis</a>.</p>

<p>My concern is not to woo the self-righteous; my interest lies rather in the fact that Hedges’s New Critique of porn casts light on the fact that we cannot expect our mere willingness for things to be okay to make them so—while tolerance is much brandied about as a method of achieving better well-being for more people (“live and let live”)â€š we cannot simply ‘accept’ our way toward a new world order. Deciding that the people who make porn and the people who watch it are all free actors, and therefore cannot/should not be subject either to moral judgment or restraint: it is at that moment that we are fooling ourselves that the greatest human value is freedom, and we are perverting the very notion of love—God’s love, if you will—through the insistence that human beings can or do know what we are doing with ourselves. And it seems more than abundantly clear that indeed we don’t know.</p>

<p>Peter Buffett’s short piece on the role of charity in the current world order highlights the fact that neither the Right’s fanatical Cult-of-Life dogma (under which abortion is the ultimate and primary evil, <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/abortion-kills-conscience-and-destroys-peace-little-known-mother-theresa-in/">à la Mother Teresa</a>) nor the Left’s Cult-of-Technology (according to which solar-charged cell phones and micro-loans will cure the world’s ills) is asking the proper question about human behavior. The first premise Buffett rejects simply by ignoring it, the second he attacks directly, invoking Matthew 6:3 in regard to the perils of the organized practice of giving: ”But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you” (Matt. 6:3-4)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of who my father is, I’ve been able to occupy some seats I never expected to sit in. Inside any important philanthropy meeting, you witness heads of state meeting with investment managers and corporate leaders. All are searching for answers with their right hand to problems that others in the room have created with their left. There are plenty of statistics that tell us that inequality is continually rising. At the same time, according to the Urban Institute, the nonprofit sector has been steadily growing…. It’s a massive business, with approximately <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100831257">$316 billion</a> given away in 2012 in the United States alone and more than 9.4 million employed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Philanthropy has become the “it” vehicle to level the playing field and has generated a growing number of gatherings, workshops and affinity groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As more lives and communities are destroyed by the system that creates vast amounts of wealth for the few, the more heroic it sounds to “give back.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is too easy to become sentimental about poverty, just as it is too easy to be consoled by the large-scale efforts at philanthropy that are a symptom of inequality rather than a cure. Buffett might have cited another New Testament gem in this regard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him. Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, said, “Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people?” Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it. Therefore Jesus said, “Let her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial. For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.” —John 12:1-8</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John, Jesus’ best friend, who told his Gospel from the closeness of lived experience and the intimacy of love, shows us both the enduring problems of the current world order and the triumph of habit over information—in this case, Judas’s habit of greed. While Judas has been reified into The Betrayer of Christ, the Gospels make clear that there was nothing so genetically or psychologically different about Judas, let alone something unique about his character flaw. Jesus, in his response to Judas’s self-righteous objection to Mary’s lavish anointing of Jesus, is no sentimentalist: as long as the current world order exists, you’re going to have the poor with you. This lack of sentimentality, any good student of the Bible will tell you, comes from the fact that Jesus’ perspective isn’t the lifespan of one man, but the promise of a new kind of Life for Man, one without injustice, sickness, suffering—and even perhaps without death. That is the change that Jesus has come to announce as on the horizon. Whether you share that hope or not, Buffett’s piece does not flinch at the fact that the measure of a human being must be his behavior toward other human beings. Away from the Micro World of embryos and Wi-fi signals there is the Middle World, a world where each person—and in particular each man—chooses how to treat other people—and in particular each woman.</p>

<p>The most irritating element of the abortion debate, in my opinion, is the ridiculous insistence that women who have abortions are killers not just of children but of conscience, a charge that flies in the face of all the love and effort mothers then and now have done for their children and their families. To claim that a mother’s love should be spontaneous, endless, and immune to any and all adversity is, frankly, disrespectful of her human limits, and it is all the more hypocritical when there is little or no discussion in these same moral contexts of how men should be behaving. Why is the discussion always that a woman has to want a child every time she has intercourse, and not that a man has to? Why is a man wanting to jack off for pleasure a given, but a woman who wants to get off without consequences evidence of a lack of conscience? Why aren’t we outraged about pornography and sex trafficking? Why aren’t we calling out the men—and women!—on this planet who watch, create, and sell porn, and the men who abuse and rape women, and who use and sell children for sex?</p>

<p>It is time we ask ourselves why all the outrage is focused on pregnant women. Do we really think that the continuous breeding of all females on earth is magically going to short-circuit all these men behaving badly?</p>

<h3 id="keep-on-using-me">Keep On Using Me…</h3>
<p>The rich get richer now without the manual labor of poor people, indeed, they do so even without the skilled mechanized labor of the vanishing middle class, or the now-endangered educatariat class of degree-holders. If the hippies of the 1960s were co-opted by Wall Street and Madison Avenue to tune back in and make some cash, the world of capital is more than content to leave their children to languish at home. The financial instruments that turn money into more money don’t need any more men and women in suits and ties to guard the fort. The fort is off-shore and the guards are machines. The cloud doesn’t need you.</p>

<p>As I sit here in a beautiful apartment in a major Germany city, poised at the beginning of a magical year of adventure, I find myself wondering what use the world can find for me—an educated, multi-lingual, cosmopolitan woman who always imagined that her talents and intelligence would make some sort of contribution to her community. Increasingly, though, the world elite seem to be saying that if you cannot help me make money—if your skills do not create profit—then I have no role for you. This is happening to men as well as women, but for women, it comes with the ever-present additional danger that for many, many men on the planet—perhaps an increasing number of them—women are merely objects for their sexual pleasure. Children, also, are increasingly exploited by adults as sexual objects.</p>

<p>Can we not be of use to one another as ends in ourselves? Or are we condemned to a world of using one another… until we are all used up?</p>

<h3 id="discrimination-my-ass">Discrimination my ass!</h3>
<p>This week, when the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf">Supreme Court ruled</a> that section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, Justice Scalia’s chickens came home to roost, prompting the same displeasure as they had as hatchlings a decade earlier, when the Supreme Court overturned Texas’s sodomy law on the grounds that it violated the Due Process Clause.</p>

<p>Due Process, a notion that originates in the Fourteenth Amendment, is designed to make sure that the law is applied equally to groups similarly circumstanced, i.e., that it does not “discriminate” in the pejorative sense. (Most laws are a matter of discrimination in the literal sense—they apply to one group and not another; 12-year-olds can’t legally drive, but that doesn’t violate Due Process).</p>

<p>In cases where the Due Process clause in invoked, there are several legal levels of scrutiny, meaning, there are different standards a given statute has to meet to satisfy Equal Protection requirements, depending what the law regards. Under the highest level of scrutiny, <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/epcscrutiny.htm">strict scrutiny</a>, “the government must show that the challenged classification serves a compelling state interest and that the classification is necessary to serve that interest.” Strict scrutiny only applies, however, when the classification used in the law is “suspect” (i.e., race, national origin, religion, or alienage) or it (the classification) burdens fundamental rights, including (but not limited to) the right to vote, the right to interstate migration, and access to the courts.</p>

<p>In the <em>Lawrence</em> decision, Scalia opined that the only way to overturn <em>Bower</em>, the precedent that held a Georgia sodomy statute constitutional, is to find that the Texas statute failed the rational basis test (the lowest level of scrutiny) or—in order to hold the law to a higher level of scrutiny—find that the right to sodomy is a fundamental right. And yet, much to Scalia’s consternation, the majority in <em>Lawrence</em> did neither: it explicitly acknowledged that it was “quite unwilling” to “announce… a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy” and it also applied what Scalia called ”an unheard-of form of rational-basis review that will have far-reaching implications beyond this case.”</p>

<p>This unheard-of form of rational-basis review is the notion that, as found by the <em>Lawrence</em> Court, laws that accord with the moral opinion of the majority are not justifiable by any state interest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Texas statute undeniably seeks to further the belief of its citizens that certain forms of sexual behavior are “immoral and unacceptable,” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14901730125647575103&amp;q=lawrence+sodomy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003"><em>Bowers, supra</em>,at 196</a>—the same interest furthered by criminal laws against fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity. <em>Bowers</em> held that this <em>was</em> a legitimate state interest. The Court today reaches the opposite conclusion. The Texas statute, it says, “furthers <em>no legitimate state interest</em> which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual,” <em>ante</em>, at 578 (emphasis added). The Court embraces instead Justice Stevens’ declaration in his <em>Bowers</em> dissent, that “‘the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice,’“ <em>ante</em>, at 577. This effectively decrees the end of all morals legislation. If, as the Court asserts, the promotion of majoritarian sexual morality is not even a <em>legitimate</em> state interest, none of the above-mentioned laws can survive rational-basis review. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284"><em>599</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scalia sees the sky about to fall, and, apparently the sky has fallen, now that the demise of DOMA has put the inevitability of mandated legalized gay marriage—the liberal majority’s intent all along, much to Scalia’s ire—even closer. In his dissent in <em>Windsor</em>, the Justice boldly accuses the majority of writing the decision with the further goal of finding a fundamental constitutional right to gay marriage, and, using the <em>Lawrence</em> decision for leverage, overturning any and all state statutes restricting marriage to heterosexual couples.</p>

<p>Scalia demonstrates what he sees as this unforgivable judicial activism by quoting sections of the majority opinion and simply changing the relevant wording. Here’s one example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“~DOMA’s~ <em>This state law’s</em> principal effect is to identify a subset of ~state-sanctioned marriages~ <em>constitutionally protected sexual relationships</em>, see <em>Lawrence</em>, and make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency. Responsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person. And ~DOMA~ <em>this state law</em> contrives to deprive some couples ~married under the laws of their State~ <em>enjoying constitutionally protected sexual relationships</em>, but not other couples, of both rights and responsibilities.” <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf"><em>23</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left;">Scalia sees the same judicial overreach here he saw in <em>Lawrence, </em>and just as he didn't believe the majority's assurance in 2003 that that decision did not have implications for gay marriage statutes, he counts as an outright misrepresentation the penultimate claim in <i>Windsor</i> that "[t]his opinion and its holding are confined" to those couples "joined in same-sex marriages made lawful by the State" <em>(</em>26, 25).</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the Court declared a constitutional right to homosexual sodomy, we were assured that the case had nothing, nothing at all to do with "whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter." <em>Id.</em>, at 578. Now we are told that DOMA is invalid because it "demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects," <em>ante</em>, at 23—with an accompanying citation of Lawrence. It takes real cheek for today's majority to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitutional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex marriage is not at issue here—when what has preceded that assurance is a lecture on how superior the majority's moral judgment in favor of same-sex marriage is to the Congress's hateful moral judgment against it. I promise you this: The only thing that will "confine" the Court's holding is its sense of what it can get away with. <em>(22)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Just(ice) You Wait!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I actually believe Scalia when he says has nothing against homosexuals. But having nothing against them does not imply that he is at all moved to grant them legal rights that a state or federal legislature is not prepared to grant. He is simply obsessed with this  notion of majority rule, believing that it is far more honorable to "let the People decide," even if this results in women being denied abortions in entire swaths of the country and even if this means that gay couples never come to share the federal benefits of marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is a purity of process to this fundamentalism of Scalia's, but it is but shallow comfort if you wish you could marry your same-sex partner, or if you need an abortion and have no means to travel to a far-off state where it remains legal. I doubt Scalia would have such respect for majority opinion if its results interfered with something he really considered fundamental to his own well-being and self-determination (or, one might add, his own political sympathies, Ã  la <em>Bush v. Gore),</em> regardless of whether it happened to coincide with the rights enumerated in the Constitution. He's just lucky, perhaps, that his interests happened to great-great-grandfathered in. Nor do I see what is so noble about his 'too bad' stance for the rest of us, either; are we supposed to feel grateful for the Court's restraint <em>on principle, </em>consoling ourselves that, although we are subject to the legislative vagaries of abortion-restricting-obsessed or homophobic right-wingers elected in hopelessly gerrymandered districts, at least there isn't one High Court arbitrarily making law? Sorry, Scalia, but one look at what Texas has managed to do to women's rights over the last several decades is enough to destroy that We the People fantasy for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I read a book recently that glorified this same attitude of Scalia, John Taylor Gatto's <em>Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling</em>, a series of rather compelling essays (mostly) about the failures of public education in America. In a late chapter, though, Gatto zooms out a bit to discuss the notion of local control (the solution to our educational morass, in Gatto's mind) in a larger contest. Using the example of the evolution of the restrictive Congregational communities of Colonial Massachusetts into the most liberal state in the nation, Gatto credits the "self-correction" process of "unconditional local choice." These elite, dogmatic communities that had expelled members of all other religious denominations gradually (i.e., over several centuries) turned tolerant of their own accord, not by having any policies mandated by outside authority. Gatto heralds that process as superior to the gains of twentieth-century progressivism:</p>

<blockquote>Think of the great progressive victories won in the courts because social engineers were unable to build popular consensus, or were unwilling to wait: affirmative action, desegregation, restrictions on graphic sexual imagery available at the local newsstand, various women's rights issues, and so on. Are these victories for the groups the courts sough to protect, or do these victories hold the same value they would have, had they been won through change in the social consensus? <em>(83)</em></blockquote>
<p>While even <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/03/11/130311fa_fact_toobin" target="_blank">Ruth Bader Ginsburg has questioned the political wisdom of <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a> (having herself pursued an incremental approach as a women’s-rights lawyer), Gatto and Scalia are obsessed by the character of social struggle to the point where they seem indifferent to the relief accorded and the lives changed via judicial means. Scalia writes:</p>
<blockquote>In the majority's telling, this story is black-and-white: Hate your neighbor or come along with us. The truth is more complicated. [...] We might have covered ourselves with honor
today, by promising all sides of this debate that it was theirs to settle and that we would respect their resolution. We might have let the People decide.

But that the majority will not do. Some will rejoice in today's decision, and some will despair at it; that is the nature of a controversy that matters so much to so many. But the Court has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat. We owed both of them better.</blockquote>
<p>While it is easy to agree that in theory that it does no good to change people’s minds by force (legislative or otherwise), I doubt blacks in the Jim Crow South would have welcomed another 50 to 100 years of segregation in order to let people change their minds on their own (never mind the previous question of slavery!), much as I am sure that women in Texas are not going to be consoled by the possibility that, one day in the future, their legislators may discover more pressing matters than closing health clinics that (as part of their services) provide abortions.</p>

<p>Yours is lovely ideal, Justice Scalia, but the timeframe of an ideal is ill-fitted to a human lifespan, and the pace of society’s natural betterment often too sluggish for those who find themselves on the unfortunate side of the majority’s moral opprobrium.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">As of this writing, this is still true, but...</p>
<p><em> that in some cases such “discrimination” is mandated by federal statute, see 10 U. S. C. §654(b)(1) (mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); </em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">the Don't Ask Don't Tell Act <a href="http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-laws/dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-act-of-2010" target="_blank">was repealed on Sept. 20, 2011</a></p>
<p><em>and that in some cases such “discrimination” is a constitutional right, see Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640 (2000).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">and on May 23, 2013, <a href="http://www.scouting.org/sitecore/content/MembershipStandards.aspx" target="_blank">61% of 1,232 voting members of the Boy Scouts of America</a>
approved a resolution stating that youth may not be denied membership
in the BSA on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone
(the policy will take effect Jan 1, 2014).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As outraged as Scalia is at what he perceives as the Court's single-minded mission to carve out rights for gays and lesbians, thus ignoring the legislative process, there is no doubt that this process is also alive and well—We the People is coming around to gay rights. And so it is disingenuous to assume that any prescience by the Court on what history surely will bear out—namely, that gay marriage helps many and harms none—constitutes <em>a priori</em> some sort of judicial tragedy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In his statement upon the announcement of decision, Rex Tillerson, past president of the Boy Scouts of America, noted the following about organizational change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is also very normal for a lot of people to feel like there were winners and there were losers. Well I'm here to tell you that's not true—in any circumstance like this. And I've seen it, over and over. I understand people that feel like there are winners and losers, but the reality is that there are neither winners nor losers.  What is left after we make the decision to change is the mission, and the mission has not changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tillerson goes on to describe the traditional activities of scouting that will soon take place as the summer season begins in order to highlight the fact that the vast majority of scouting will not change—and is not being asked to change, as everyone in the organization wants the camping and learning to continue. It is too easy, he remarks, to be overwhelmed by what is changing, and in so doing, forget the knowns of the mission. "The main thing," he reminds his audience in closing, "is to serve more youth."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although Scalia loathes what he feels as the Courts interference in a process of change the Framers reserved for the legislative branch, this sentiment still applies. The mission of government is to serve the people that constitute it, and that has not changed. In his blind deference to the notion of majority rule, Scalia has confused himself as to the purpose of government, which is not the passive activity of moral judgment, but the action of service.</p>

<h3 id="london-hacking-in-the-street">London, Hacking in the Street</h3>
<p>Michael Adebolajo is a British-born citizen of Nigerian descent, but apparently neither the circumstances of his birth, nor his upbringing in London, nor the Christianity of his parents provided a bulwark against what has been characterized as his radicalization by jihadist Islam, a process that apparently began when he was fifteen and culminated a few days ago in his participation in the brutal murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in suburban London. (And included, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22673164">several years ago</a>, an arrest in Kenya after attempting to enter Somalia to train with jihadists.)</p>

<p>The now-viral video confrontation with one of the passers-by reveals the sang-froid, indeed, the casualness with which he committed this act, but its more important revelation may be the earnestness with which the young man wants to speak to others, if only he can get them to listen. He is not ranting at the man videoing him, or at the anticipated audience in general. Indeed, he is apologizing for the overt nature of his act (not, of course, the act itself), for it is not the murder itself that he wants witnessed. Rather, he wants the attention that he knows he can garner for having murdered. In part, he uses the spotlight to express his anger against Western governments for waging war in Muslim nations, nations with which he identifies himself completely.</p>

<p>But beyond these clichÃ©s of Islamist terrorism in which all non-Muslims are the enemy, and all murders of infidels are justified by the killing of Muslims around the world, Adebolajo seems to have another layer of concern in which he is not hostile to his audience, but in fact identifies with them and even has sympathy for them. In a remark that could not be more contrary to the notion that every infidel is an equally implicated, and therefore legitimate, target, Adebolajo explains that the politicians have no skin in the game that they are playing; it is the little people—like the solidier, like the by-standers, like himself—who risk and lose their lives to the wars concocted by the powers that be.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://world.time.com/2013/05/22/man-hacked-to-death-in-suspected-terrorist-attack-in-london/">comment posted on the Time World website</a>, a user named EdLifton suggested that it wasn’t lofty ideas that motivated Adebolajo so much as the feeling of littleness—and the need to overcome it—that is characteristic of narcissism. In this reading, the actions are not parseable politically but psychologically, i.e., the need to act to assuage such feelings far exceeds the political impact of the act itself. But if one requirement of narcissism is delusions of grandeur (à la Mohammed Atta), Adebolajo doesn’t qualify: instead of dispatching himself to a martyr-filled heaven (say, with a suicide bomb), he waits around to get shot at by the police (and then arrested and taken to hospital). The frenzied murder appears as a momentary escape from the general banality of the life of a little person.</p>

<p>Indeed, in my mind, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt-ySTx3xH8">the most compelling aspect of the video itself</a> [start at 0:46] is the dark-skinned woman, her hair covered (perhaps a Muslim?), towing her grocery cart across the scene, observing but apparently not all that alarmed by the just-completed murder. As Adebolajo concludes his speech, the woman passes by him on the sidewalk, barely glancing at him as she skirts around him, perhaps not perceiving, or perhaps choosing not to look at, his bloodied hands and the bloody weapons they still hold.</p>

<p>What is her story? Does she simply discount violence on the street as the misfortune of others, best not to think too much about? Did she think it was a traffic accident? Is she accustomed to violence, and perhaps was non-plussed? Did she purposely avoid even noticing what was going on in that street, because she couldn’t be bothered? The irony here is pretty rich: Adebolajo is trying to alarm people about the consequences of the fact that America and Britain (and other allies) have been fighting and killing militants and civilians in Afghanistan (among other places), and here walks by a woman who clearly could not give a shit about what he’s up to.</p>

<p>The irony is even deeper, though, when you consider that it is precisely the attitude of that woman that keeps the world going—she’s keeping calm and carrying on.  She’s not interested in jihad; she’s interested in getting home and getting off her feet. As are most of us, no? If this weren’t the case, meaning, if we were all interested in committing or responding to violence with violence, we’d all be dead in the streets. The terror instilled by Adebolajo is, I think it is safe to say, the worry that more and more people will break out of this peace-promoting attitude of apathy and decide to commit murder instead of, say, go to the movies. (Already <a href="http://www.thelocal.fr/20130527/attacker-prayed-before-knifing-paris-soldier">a knifing of a soldier in Paris</a> is under investigation as a copy cat attack.)</p>

<p>This is a legitimate worry, because it is the individual who chooses, and short of a society in which no one is free and most are miserable (think North Korea), there is no way to guarantee individual safety while honoring individual liberty. Personal liberty exists by the grace of personal discretion, and there is only so much degradation of individual tendencies (i.e., toward violence, greed, dishonesty, etc.) that a society can tolerate and still be free. In this way, Adebolajo’s murder in the streets (despite its origins in jihad) is no different than Adam Lanza’s shooting spree in Newtown, Connecticut, or James Holmes’s at the movies in Aurora, Colorado: they introduce violence into a setting where we had enjoyed an expectation of safety, thus breaking an essential social covenant.</p>

<h3 id="paris-shooting-at-the-altar">Paris, Shooting at the Altar</h3>
<p>Hovering like a wasp around Dominique Venner’s final pessimistic outburst about the fall of the West is the irony that, on the issue of gay marriage, he and the Islamists are on the same side: deeply against it. Venner’s allegiance to the far right puts a lie to the notion that the fault line between the West and its enemies is simply social liberalism. On the contrary, Venner has the same fight to pick with the Islamists as he does with the more progressive elements of his own culture: the battle of a deep conservative against any and all change. He is just as incensed by the change represented by immigration as he is the internal transformations within France’s existing white, (nominally) Catholic population. In short, he’s an equal opportunity hater.</p>

<p>Considered from a psychological standpoint, a Catholic’s commission of suicide (a mortal sin) in a church (an act of desecration) suggests that Mr. Venner’s problems ran deeper than politically-engaged rage. Even when considered as a political act, Mr. Venner had to know that even if his death counted as one of the “new, spectacular and symbolic gestures” he believed were required to wake people up, it seems less reasonable to suppose that such a betrayal of his supposed values could function as part of the “intellectual and moral reform” he believed, quoting Renan Camus, was necessary to prevent the fall of Europe to Islamists. While Venner is convinced that street demonstrations (the hallmark perhaps of dissent in Western democracies) will be insufficient, his actions do not seem to match his rhetoric; after all, the notion of “fighting back the infidels” has a long European history, but it appears that Europe has lost its interest in both Crusades and colonialism. Perhaps his death is an acknowledgment that the only kind of violence conservatism can achieve is self-immolation.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Venner only injured himself in his dramatic suicide at Notre Dame Cathedral last week, while Mr. Adebolajo committed murder, both men seem to be actors caught on a stage without an audience, having cast themselves in roles and scripts that are more fiction than fact <em>as far as regards them personally</em>. It is certainly true that the emergence of a tolerant, successfully multicultural Europe is a work-in-progress, but Mr. Venner’s apocalyptic sense of European demise is just as much a product of his imagination as Mr. Adebolajo’s allegiance with all Muslims in his unnamed “our land”.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Muslims aren’t being killed by Western armies in armed conflicts and by drone warfare (indeed, as we learned this week, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2013/0522/Drone-strikes-Four-American-citizens-killed-in-drone-strikes-video">even American citizens have been targeted</a>). But it is to say that the Muslims of Britain are not in this situation, and indeed are busy with lives that have no interest in violence, just like the woman who walks by him while he is being videoed. While Adebolajo may have been radicalized to believe that he is an outsider in the country in which he has been born and raised, this radicalization is not a point of fact but a mindset, even a delusion. While his actions are terrifying, his murder of a British soldier does not actually make his delusion more of a reality. The reality is more fully captured by the woman who walks by him—<em>that</em> is the land in which Adebolajo lives, despite his efforts to make it something it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. Venner is similarly driven to excess by delusion, seeing in his likely even-keeled day-to-day reality a cataclysm that simply isn’t there. Perhaps it is too easy for me, who sees no cultural threat in same-sex marriage, to dismiss his concerns. But it is not defensible to agree that simply by allowing same-sex couples equal rights under the law that something has been taken away from others. In this way, Mr. Venner’s loss is as imaginary as is Mr. Adebolajo’s connection to Afganistan.  </p>

<p>These two sketches paint the same definition of extremism: an extremist is someone who narcissistically mistakes his own internal need for validation for the pressing struggles of his fellow man. The greatest stories of human struggle and hope (from story of Exodus to the American and French Revolutions to Civil Rights) have in common a recognition of the needs of many, rather than a violent, destructive ignorance of the real goals and activities of human society. No amount of security (whether at airports or at schools) can prevent a hell-bent attacker from carrying out his or her mission; our best hope is to engage ourselves in the activities of living that narcissist terrorists are incapable of acknowledging.</p>

<p>We need to keep calm and carry on.</p>

<h3 id="one-famous">One Famous</h3>
<p>The all-but-state funeral for Margaret Thatcher earlier this month had the peculiar effect of eliding the sizable period of time between the end of the Iron Lady’s reign as Prime Minister (in 1990) and her death. Although she remained in public life for over a decade after that, writing memoirs and giving speeches, her second retirement (as we might dub it) was still over ten years ago. As the recent film “The Iron Lady” makes clear, in her final years, Thatcher suffered from vascular dementia prompted by brain damage suffered during a series of small strokes in March 2002. It was another stroke that finally ended her life this year.</p>

<p>Possibly we are scared by the idea that the body outlives the public persona, or, more specifically, the person’s public utility; this is certainly suggested by the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/8996782/David-Cameron-The-Iron-Lady-should-have-been-delayed.html">negative reactions</a> to the film’s depictions of Thatcher as an old woman suffering from dementia. There is a certain irony to David Cameron’s wish for the film to have been delayed, for certainly whatever insult Streep’s honest portrayal provokes is insulting only to those with the luxury of plausible deniability of her day-to-day life. His complaint that “it’s really a film about ageing, dementia, rather than a wonderful prime minister,” confirms his wish not to be reminded of the unfortunate excess of the physical life of the body.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/">Alzheimer’s Society</a>”, a British support and advocacy organization, is hopeful that high-profile victims of dementia such as Thatcher will remove some of the obvious stigma surrounding the disease. Upon Thatcher’s death, Jeremy Hughes, the organization’s executive director, <a href="http://www.carehome.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1559713/alzheimers-society-hopes-thatchers-death-will-help-tackle-stigma-of-dementia">noted that</a> ”one in three people over 65 will develop dementia but for too long dementia has been kept in the shadows and families have been left to struggle alone.” Thatcher’s daughter Carol wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swim-Part-Goldfish-Bowl-Memoir/dp/0755317068">a memoir</a> which included a discussion of her mother’s struggles, including the fact that Thatcher would have to be reminded that her husband Dennis had died (in 2003). Carol wrote: “I had to keep giving the bad news over and over again. Every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years, she’d look at me sadly and say ‘oh’, as I struggled to compose myself.”</p>

<p>That dementia is sad and frightening is not in dispute; so are many other deteriorations, physical and mental, of aging. The particular social discomfort of dementia, the one hinted at by David Cameron, seems to rest in the way it probes the limitations of the support structure of the nuclear family: patience, loyalty and financial resources are all tested when a family member suffers from cognitive decline, sometimes to the breaking point. Thatcher clearly took a lot of pride in work and familial self-sufficiency, but it is these same values that keep illnesses such as dementia out of sight and out of mind, a situation of questionable benefit not just to the families who must cope, but for everyone else, too. I am not talking about the financial burdens of illness, as in the context of Britain such a concern is much less an issue, but rather the subtle promotion of the idea that once you no longer meet this self-sufficient expectation, you are no longer fit to appear in the world. The family is thus not only the institution that should, as Thatcher opined, make us self-sufficient, it must also be the institution that covers up any lack of self-sufficiency. This strikes me as an entirely political notion of what the family does, by which I mean it is entirely oriented toward the emergence (under limited conditions) of an individual into the world-at-large. It is emphatically and defiantly not personal.</p>

<h3 id="the-other-almost-forgotten">The Other (Almost) Forgotten</h3>
<p>Another woman with polarizing ideas died recently, also of a disease—schizophrenia—that is highly stigmatized. Shulamith Firestone, a radical feminist who imagined a Marxist-inspired, cybernetic utopia in which women and children were liberated from the  sexual and economic dependency constituted by the nuclear family unit, was found dead in her New York apartment last August. Reading her opus, <em>The Dialectic of Sex</em>, one is struck by the text’s simultaneous far-reaching and time-boundedness; her passages on the education of children could not be more contemporary in their perception of the failures of the traditional education system to stimulate children toward productive maturity, just as her discussion of overpopulation could not be more landlocked in 1960s preoccupations whose irrelevance the intervening decades have made plain.</p>

<p>Firestone is a pumpkin eater of radical feminism, minus the wife reference; as Susan Faludi’s recent article in the <em>New Yorker</em> puts it: “Shulamith Firestone helped to create a new society. But she couldn’t live in it.” Already in 1970, the publication year of the <em>Dialectic</em>, things were headed downhill for Firestone; the fourth organization she’d founded, the New York Radical Feminists, had dissolved over internal conflicts. Firestone had the vision, but short of a Marxist, cybernetic revolution that would free people from drudge work, there was no refuge. Whatever wished-for sisterhood of the radical movement was inadequate to protect those, like Firestone, who would forsake the existing structures of work and family. For a while in the mid-1990s, a support network was cobbled together that allowed her to write a memoir in the form of a <em>roman à clef</em>, <em>Airless Spaces</em>, which was published in 1998. But when the women, including her psychiatrist, all moved on with their own lives, Firestone slipped back into illness and seclusion. It is speculated that she starved to death, deluded by her schizophrenia into believing that her food was poisoned.</p>

<p>One arrangement that Firestone envisioned as an alternative to the nuclear family structure was the <em>household</em>, “a group of ten or some consenting adults of varying ages” who agreed to live together for a contracted period, “perhaps seven to ten years, or whatever was decided on as the minimal time in which children needed a stable structure to grow up in.” Children would comprise say a third of each household; “(minimal) responsibility for the early physical dependence of children would be evenly distributed among all members of the household.” Firestone hopes that through social changes or even the creation of artificial reproduction that the parental feeling of ownership of children would be eliminated, thus making children autonomous and in possession of full legal rights, rather than minors as they are currently termed. “We want to destroy [a mother’s] possessiveness along with its cultural reinforcements so that no one child will be <em>a priori</em> favored over another, so that children will be loved for their own sake.” One right of children would be the right to request a transfer to a different household if he or she did not like “the household into which he had been born so arbitrarily…”</p>

<p>If Firestone’s vision seems implausibly wacky, she deserves credit for having anticipated changes that have already occurred in the decades since she wrote the <em>Dialectic</em>, such as the end of stigmas against cohabitation without marriage and homosexuality. While obviously these shifts are not global, they are, in much of the Western world, already past the tipping point of acceptance. (Although it is worth noting the irony, from a Firestone perspective, of the fact that homosexuality has gained more acceptance as it has increasingly insisted that it represents and fosters the same values as ‘traditional’ marriage.) It is important to understand that Firestone’s vision of the household is not a prescription, but rather a suggestion of a way of living that acknowledges a genuine liking of children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have seen that parental satisfaction is obtainable only though crippling the child: the attempted extension of ego through one’s children—in the case of the man, the ‘immortalizing’ of name, property, class, and ethnic identification, and in the case of the woman, motherhood as the justification of her existence, the resulting attempt to live through the child, child-as-project—in the end damages or destroys either the child or the parent, or both when neither wins, as the case may be. Perhaps when we strip parenthood of these other functions, we will find a real instinct for parenthood even on the part of men, a simple physical desire to associate with the young. […] If a parenthood instinct does in fact exist, it will [in the household] be allowed to operate even more freely, having shed the practical burdens of parenthood that now make it such an anguished hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firestone speaks so plainly, so sensitively to the dissatisfactions of existing institutions that it is jarring when she so confidently asserts that one of the main failures of the family is its repression of sexuality, not only of adults but of children. In current mainstream culture, adults who sexualize children are deviants, and children are in part defined as children by their lack of sexual awareness. The legitimate fears about these issues—for ultimately sexual abuse, like rape, is a crime of power before it is a crime of sex—make it very difficult to accept Firestone’s forecasts that with the family structure dissolved, and the incest taboo meaningless, sexuality will revert to “a more natural polymorphous sexuality.” Firestone is as convinced of the harms of current power arrangements (those that subordinate women and children) as she is optimistic about the liberating potential of a radical feminist revolution. She has a fantastic faith in the possibilities of human relationships unfettered from the structures of familial obligation, woven together instead by the pleasures, both simple and profound, of human love.</p>

<p>If only they could have saved her.</p>

<h3 id="skim-milk-morality">Skim-milk morality</h3>
<p>Eternal youth, though not the malevolent kind bestowed on Wilde’s poor Dorian Gray, would have been an interesting perspective from which to have witnessed the sea change that has occurred in the West over the last century in regard to the personal, moral, social, and legal understandings of same-sex relations and relationships. For it is the young, the surveys consistently say, that are responsible for taking in stride what many of their most liberal-minded elders initially found it hard to stomach. What would it feel like, I wonder, for someone who magically remained an immortal member of the latest generation, to feel his or her moral attitudes evolve with the times, despite the memories of convictions no longer remembered or felt by others? Would it feel strange and destabilizing to see the rate at which human norms alter and shift, or would it feel wonderfully refreshing, an inner renewal to complement the permanence of physical youth? Would our immortal witness become cynical in the face of persistent change, or would she marvel at such evolutions as a crucial hallmark of the human spirit?</p>

<p>Perhaps not coincidentally, these two hypothetical reactions of our fantastic observer somewhat align with conservative and liberal political attitudes. Conservatives believe that what is once a positive value is always so, and it must upset them that, simply by standing still, they appear move from the mainstream to the rocky shoals of bigotry. Liberals, on the other hand, are happy to embrace today the folks they consigned to the DSM-IV a generation ago, considering it a point of pride that today they, and their children, simply know better than to fear and denigrate those they mistakenly believed to be fundamentally different.</p>

<p>That <em>mistakenly</em> is a key point, for Ms. Kaplan is surely right that is not an acceptance (in the sense of mere tolerance, where what is tolerated is still viewed as something radically different) that has motivated such a sea change in American opinion, but rather the opposite, namely, a new appreciation of homosexuality that deemphasizes difference. Many Americans feel, and younger ones in particular, that gender doesn’t matter that much in the construction of a committed relationship: whatever the gender composition of the couple, the means and ends of that togetherness are felt to be the same. Americans have therefore not moved toward the concept of homosexuality so much as gays and lesbians, as people, have moved toward Americans. And Americans, despite the pervasiveness of divorce and the skyrocketing rise in unmarried cohabitation and single motherhood, really get a kick out of celebrating and promoting marriage: in a kind of avant-la-Facebook way, we <em>like</em> it.</p>

<p>At the time of Stonewall, when the central issue facing the gay community was the right to congregate without being harassed, beaten, and arrested, the gap between that so-called “lifestyle” and the rest of America seemed insurmountable. (Not to mention the fact that, in the 1950s, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37kHRMSdsj4">homosexuality was treated as the equivalent of sexual predation of men against teenage boys</a> When someone doesn’t want the same things that you do, it is entirely too easy to dismiss them as alien or other or perverse or what have you. I’m not saying, of course, that this reaction is justified or justified. But it is certainly real, and it is most certainly the go-to reaction by a social majority seeking to buttress and perpetuate its own practices and institutions.</p>

<p>The moment, however, that the gay pride movement matured to the point where that pride could be expressed not only as pride-in-difference, but as a fundamental human solidarity, the sea change began. If you want what I want—namely, to be free to love, to marry, to raise children—well, then you cannot be that different from me. And if you are not so different, well, I cannot find it in my heart and mind to loathe you. Moral feeling, pardon my saying so, is like orgasm: you either arrive at it or you don’t.</p>

<p>This visceral aspect of moral objection is perhaps what troubles Antonin Scalia, who has the unfortunate habit of equating the moral admission of same-sex relationships with the collapse of moral mechanics altogether. At a speech given at Princeton, when asked by a student why he consistently equates laws against sodomy with those banning bestiality and murder, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2012/12/11/scalia-reductios-himself-ad-absurdum-on-murder-and-homosexuality/">Scalia replied</a>: “If we cannot have moral feelings against homosexuality, can we have it against murder? Can we have it against other things?” For most of us, this <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> hypothetical does not pose a problem, but Scalia clearly feels that he is being asked to override his own internal sense of what is moral on behalf of a public consensus that has begun to move on without him. Understandably, this puts him in a destabilized position that is rather unenviable. It must be tough to wake up on the highest court in the land and realize that public opinion is passing you by. Irrelevance is the harshest blow of social evolution.</p>

<h3 id="blinded-by-the-right">Blinded by the Right</h3>
<p>Speaking of irrelevance, let’s talk about the GOP. While individuals are free to stick in the mud as long as they please—and of course, let’s not pretend that the issue is truly settled, with 49% of Americans in favor of gay marriage and 44% against—a political party holds one thing more dear than its principles: winning. Given which way the wind is blowing, though, it stands to reason that if the Republicans would benefit from conceding a loss in the culture wars, and becoming again the party of the Big Tent.</p>

<p>First of all, given that people who tend to be conservative on social issues are also so on economic ones, the Republicans aren’t likely to alienate their base (as the odd expression goes) if they drop the litmus test of being anti-choice and anti-gay, because those voters aren’t likely going to suddenly see the Democratic Party as more in line with their views. Whether or not those folks would just stay at home, or vote for a third party, is hard to predict, but at the very least, the Republicans could, in the next primary season, not spend the entire time competing to say the newest, stupidest thing in their eagerness to get to the right of one another on these fronts.</p>

<p>The Republicans seem to have forgotten the best play in their own playbook: redefine yourself to win, the way Nixon was advised to do in bringing an anti-abortion stance into the platform for the first time in the 1972. While state legislatures seem obsessed with passing new laws restricting abortion, clearly on a national level, the issue doesn’t have the kind of pull it once did. Therefore, just drop it. The Party can’t afford to share the view of <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/24/175201923/millennials-and-same-sex-marriage-a-waning-divide">Eric Teetsel, the executive director of the Manhattan Declaration</a>, a conservative activist group, who balks at a shift on cultural issues, specifically gay marriage, as unprincipled. “You don’t hear us talking about backing away from other core principles that aren’t necessarily popular… To change your principles in order to win voters over is the kind of thing that we view negatively in American politics.” Teetsel may not be alone in this viewpoint, but as a self-described Christian first, conservative second, and Republican way down the list, he’s not the person the Republicans can—or should want to!—rely on to win them back the White House, because there are not enough people like him to carry the day for the GOP. There is a certain irony to the idea that the Republicans have gone from the party of easy, general appeal (Reagan, anyone?) to that of hard-sell principles; as I recall from my childhood, that used to be the short straw drawn, election after election, by the Democrats.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/03/6-big-takeaways-from-the-rncs-incredible-election-autopsy.php?ref=fpb">RNC post-mortem</a> on the failures of the 2012 campaign, several of the recommendations warn precisely against the attitudes here espoused by Teetsel. In addition to stating specifically that the party must begin to move to the left on gay rights issues, it also declares that the party is indeed at risk for what is known as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/books/28conserv.html">epistemic closure</a>, meaning, it resists all dissenting voices to the point where it is successful in articulating its ideas only to those who already share them. (Surely this helps to explain the ridiculous comments about rape that fell out of the mouths of one Republican after another last year.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself… We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue. Instead of driving around in circles on an ideological cul-de-sac, we need a Party whose brand of conservatism invites and inspires new people to visit us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pragmatic advice, and the GOP would be well to take it. Indeed, it would be downright <em>groundbreaking</em> were we to have a national election in which the wedge issues of abortion, gay-rights, and illegal immigration were somehow tabled. It could turn into a legitimate and wonderful free-for-all, where, for staters, pro-choice women would have the option to vote their minds and checkbooks rather than just their uteruses. I can’t help but think that this would function to actually <em>improve</em> the Democratic Party as well, given that they would no longer be able to take certain constituencies for granted. But I digress…</p>

<h3 id="boy-in-a-bubble">Boy in a Bubble</h3>
<p>The discomfort that Justice Scalia transmutes into provocation (as only he can) points directly to the issue that interests me in this post, namely, what happens in a cultural context when one person’s principle starts to become someone else’s bigotry. Those who arrive at the opposition to gay marriage from a religious point of view perhaps have no choice but to maintain their opposition, although it is unlikely that, if gay marriage is gradually made legal, state by state, that it will lodge itself in the public craw the way abortion has. Among those simply unenthused, the flow of the new status quo will likely carry them along; indeed, judging from the festival-like atmosphere outside the courthouse, where many posters urged for marriage equality on the tongue-in-cheek basis that gays and lesbians should have the opportunity to be as miserably married as straight couples, the very notion of gay rights now includes supporting a shared vision of contemporary American life (à la <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-7IA54-tmE">Kindle commercial</a> This is what Ms. Kaplan is talking about when she speaks about the difference between 1996 and now. Add to it the smiling interracial couples that hold signs reminding onlookers that, not so long ago, they wouldn’t have been allowed to marry, and you come away with a sense that allowing people to love whom they choose is a net gain to society.</p>

<p>As a constitutional matter, things are of course not that simple. Scalia, having made a career of locking himself in a Constitutional time warp, arrives at his conviction that states can legislate morality based on the notion that the founding document doesn’t make it unconstitutional to do so. Here is an excerpt from Tuesday’s oral argument in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/?wpmp_switcher=desktop"><em>Hollingsworth v. Perry</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JUSTICE SCALIA: The California Supreme Court decides what the law is. That’s what we decide, right? We don’t prescribe law for the future. We—we decide what the law is. I’m curious, when—when did—when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage? 1791? 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted? Sometimes—some time after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Nelson">Baker</a>, where we said it didn’t even raise a substantial Federal question? When—when—when did the law become this?<br />
MR. OLSON: When—may I answer this in the form of a rhetorical question? When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit interracial marriages?  When did it become unconstitutional to assign children to separate schools.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It’s an easy question, I think, for that one. At—at the time that the Equal Protection Clause was adopted. That’s absolutely true. But don’t give me a question to my question. <em>[Laughter.]</em> When do you think it became  unconstitutional? Has it always been unconstitutional?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good question, and certainly the difficulties that Theodore Olson (speaking for the Respondents) has in providing a good answer point to the can of worms that an equal protection argument would open, especially in the context of <em>Hollingsworth</em>, which deals, in theory, solely with California’s Proposition 8. In the cases of interracial marriages and school segregation, when they were ruled unconstitutional, all states had to comply with those rulings. No matter what you feel about the legitimacy of marriage equality, a national ruling that would compel all 50 states to legalize gay marriage is likely to create a huge public-opinion backlash. The possibility of such an outcome is arguably even greater  in the Windsor case, where the equal protection argument is more relevant: if the Court rules that state-sanctioned same-sex marriages must be recognized for the purpose of federal benefits, can it stop short of maintaining that all states <em>must</em> recognize such marriages—even when it is agreed upon by all sides that it is the states that are in charge of marriage law?</p>

<p>Scalia’s question of when something became unconstitutional is both misleading and also incredibly telling. I believe that it is indeed true that the right for gays and lesbians to enter into the civil contracts known as marriage <em>is</em> protected by the Equal Protection Clause, and thus, technically speaking, laws that restrict gays and lesbians from marrying became unconstitutional when the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution. Of course, this fact of timing does not tell us anything about when the Court will <em>recognize</em> this right as having always existed. When Scalia says that answering the question of when school segregation or interracial marriage became unconstitutional is easy, what he is really saying is that one easily recognizes, in 2013, that these rights are found within the Equal Protection Clause. And so it should be easy, as soon we will mark fifty years since both <em>Loving</em> was decided, and sixty since <em>Brown</em>—not to mention the approaching sesquicentennial of the Fourteenth Amendement itself in 2018. Scalia’s skepticism is evident when he implies to Ms. Kaplan that perhaps 9 states doesn’t constitute a true sea change, but even his skepticism outlines the parameters within which the nation will grown toward greater acceptance, both cultural and legal, of gay marriage.</p>

<p>In the unanimous decision in <em>Loving</em>, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marriage is one of the “basic civil rights of man,” fundamental to our very existence and survival…. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe the country is not ready to hear the phrase “gender-based sexual preference” in place of “racial classifications”. One day, however, it will be. Times blind, but they also change.</p>

<h3 id="reaching-for-the-glass">Reaching for the Glass</h3>
<p>I heard on NPR the other day that the twitterverse lit up during the Republican Response to the State of the Union address when Marco Rubio reached for an offstage bottle of water around minute eleven. Apparently, it is a lot easier to respond to that meaningless interruption in under 140 characters than it is to grapple with the purported content of the response. Linda Holmes, in <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/02/13/171903635/rubio-s-water-bottle-and-the-authenticity-craving">her NPR piece on the event</a>, connected that gaffe to the blackout at the Superbowl, saying that these kinds of happenings attract interest because, in a sea of the scripted, they represent an eddy of authenticity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In all honesty, the water gulp was just about the only part of that evening you couldn’t have known was going to happen 24 hours earlier. Just like the blackout, it was the major plot development (minor as it was) that felt like a collapse of the narrative, and the truth is, people <em>like</em> collapsed narratives. They feel, to use a nonword, <em>real-er</em>, truer, simpler, and more reflective of our experiences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holmes’ connection between the collapsed narrative and authenticity strikes me as a rather curious paring. It suggests something rather odd about the notion of narrative itself, namely, that when it is functioning properly, it feels boring and/or fake. Basically, Holmes’ definition of narrative here is basically that of spin: non-nuanced, predictable, and anti-climatic.</p>

<p>Without disputing the fact that our two-party politics has degenerated into both parties saying that they want what is best for American families while remaining unable to agree on anything except the least-sensical proposal of all, the looming Sequester, aka the Fiscal Cliff, historically (by which I mean in ancient Greece) politics was a realm that was so highly regarded precisely because it dealt in the realm of nuance and the unpredictable. Accordingly, the means of politics, rhetorical speech, was regarded as the highest form of human activity, and the honor of participating in the formation of events was restricted to a small group of men. The narrative form that imitated and enshrined this human activity was none other than Greek tragedy, which was born in the midst of the Athenian <em>polis</em>. In short, the very notion of drama—of climatic and difficult narratives—came out of an appreciation of the unpredictability of human interaction.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is hopeless, in the way of modernism, post-modernism, and post-post-modernism, to try to argue against the viewpoint that, in this day and age, narrative in its original operational form no longer ‘works’, and therefore we get our thrills from the points where it is collapsed, punctured, dismantled, made fun of. While there is plenty of art and literature that functions though subversion of traditional narrative techniques, its success in doing so depends on the audience’s awareness of such tradition. Arguably, all movements that have sought to undermine or subvert a previous order have, originally, emerged from within order. And nor do those movements necessarily supplant what came before, at least not immediately; most often, they come into their own along side it.</p>

<p>Therefore I’m not convinced that the excitement that we get from things going wrong (mere <em>schadenfreude</em>), whether in political speeches or major sporting events, has anything to do with a craving for so-called ‘collapsed narratives,’ or a craving for the ‘real’ over the ‘scripted’. ‘Reality,’ as any good post-modernist will tell you, is not the absence of scripting. Reality itself is scripted—by the mind, by language, by culture, and, ever-increasingly, by ‘social’ media. This latest turn of the screw leads many people to believe that reality consists in what people say about them, one of the basic falsehoods of life we were all supposed to have exploded for us in childhood.</p>

<p>But to return to the original discussion, the complaint about entertainment being scripted is misguided. We all watch entertainment that is entirely, in terms of its narrative gestures, predictable—at least from a structural standpoint. Whether you are watching <em>The Good Wife</em> or <em>The Amazing Race</em>, what keeps your attention is the creation, management and climax/resolution of the essential narrative mainstay since the Greeks: action (or, put another way, conflict). Action is the way the Greeks would have understood it, for they understood action as a priori in a collective, political context, and therefore inherently fraught with uncertainty and danger; since the term action has lost these connotations, it is perhaps more intelligible for us to say conflict, which recovers some of those connotations.</p>

<p>I seem to be on the verge of claiming that there is no conflict <em>within</em> our political speeches or our Superbowls, and so that is why the only element of interest is a conflict <em>around</em> them (water break, power outage). I think that’s a fair statement, although the caveat that must be understood is the modern (for the Greeks anyway) separation between political speech and political action. In the context of the <em>polis</em>, what you spoke was already a form of action. Nowadays, the state and society go on regardless of what anyone says (meaning, regardless of the conflicts spoken about), dependent much more on the stability of financial markets than the consistency of political discourse. (This is why regimes that restrict speech in order to maintain power seem so retro.) If Marco Rubio’s words were spoken in such a context (a political actor among other actors), his drinking water would be beside the point, rather than the only point anyone could find worth mentioning. The risk would be in his words, not in his reaching for a beverage.</p>

<h3 id="never-again">Never Again</h3>
<p>Every February, Valentine’s Day serves as a good occasion to talk about issues regarding love and marriage. This time, the NY Time’s “Room For Debate” featured a discussion between Vicki Larson and Beverly Willett, the latter of whom is the co-chair of the <a href="http://divorcereform.us/">Coalition for Divorce Reform</a></p>

<p>Ms. Willett, like perhaps many spouses, found herself in the predicament of not wanting to get divorced while her husband did. Under current no-fault divorce law, however, it only takes one person’s desire to get divorced to make that result inevitable. Ms. Willett was able to prolong the fight for her marriage for five years due only to the fact that she and her husband resided in New York State, which for many years remained the only state in the nation without no-fault divorce. (The state <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/nyregion/16divorce.html?_r=0">changed the law in 2010</a> Yet even under that old system, even the judges did not seem sympathetic to the notion of a wife wanting to legally obligate her husband to remain married when he had already taken up with another woman. If anything, the law was designed to allow Ms. Willett to sue her adulterous husband for divorce in order to spare her the pain of remaining married to someone who had deserted her.</p>

<p>For Ms. Willett, who was willing to forgive her husband’s behavior in order to keep her family together, the law offered no help. Ms. Willett views this as a shortcoming of the law, and supports the <a href="http://divorcereform.us/parental-divorce-reduction-act/">Parental Divorce Reduction Act</a>, which, though mandated counseling and waiting periods, seeks to reduce what it calls “unnecessary” divorces where there are minor children involved. The problem, as Ms. Larson points out, is that what may be a necessary divorce to some may not feel like that to others. Have people gotten divorced because they were selfish and pig-headed and didn’t want to work on themselves or their relationship? Undoubtedly. Have those divorces had negative consequences for children involved? Probably. And yet you have to ask yourself whether the law exists to prevent these situations. Perhaps the reason the law offers no help is because the law can only respond to behavior, not create it.</p>

<p>Of course it is hoped—as in the case of laws against drunk driving or texting-while-moving—that a legal change will influence behavior, but whatever the behavior, it existed before the law conferred upon it the status of a misdemeanor or crime. In the case of marriage, which exists to establish a particular contractual status between two individuals, the law functions not as an incentive, but as a legal overlay to a cultural institution. So when the culture shifted and people wanted easier divorce, the law accommodated them. Likewise, it is a cultural shift that is driving the legalization of same-sex marriage. No matter what you think of no-fault divorce or same-sex marriage, you have to admit that the law is much better at being the permissive parent (“If this is what you want, okay”) than the moralizing one (“I’m not going to let you do this because I know it’s not for the best”). Basically, if religion couldn’t keep us all happily (or even unhappily!) married, then the law hasn’t got a chance.</p>

<p>Ms. Willett taps into a very American ideal in her wish to prevent other couples from divorcing: the desire to make things better for the next person. This is an excellent example of what Joan Didion means about our desire “to transform the white flag of defeat at home into the brave white banner of battle away from home.” Personal hardship has long been the rallying cry for collective action. And in certain cases, it is possible to change the larger circumstances of a situation so that things don’t happen all over again the same way. The fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory changed working conditions for factory workers; the creation of Social Security and Medicare has kept many elderly people out of the poverty they would have otherwise fallen into. What leads us to this sense of right action is our apprehension of common humanity, this notion that “but for the grace of God there go I.” But the other side of this natural sympathy is an almost equally natural self-righteousness, that feeling that the world should be structured after one’s own sense of rectitude. It is not a far hop from a feeling indulgent toward the poor to feeling distrustful of their own capacities to decide for themselves. Our experience becomes not so much a well of sympathy (compassion) but a recipe book (prescription): if my divorce—or abortion, or what-have-you—was a mistake, then all divorces, etc. are mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="charity-begins-at-home">Charity Begins at Home</h3>
<p>I was talking to a friend of mine about the concept of a voting district, and how party-based gerrymandering has given us a more-or-less polarized national legislature in which the parties equally believe that they represent their constituents and yet they are unable to work together on anything. Wouldn’t a system where the center could hold be much more effective? Why, he asked me, do you think compromise is so great? Instead of one side being unhappy, both sides are. The problem, he went on, isn’t in how we elect our national representatives, it is in the fact that we try to decide too many things on a national level.</p>

<p>My friend’s libertarian live-and-let live vision depends not on representation but on distribution. Basically, the laws and customs of a certain area would be governed by the residents of that place. For example, people in the city don’t think guns are necessary, so you wouldn’t carry them there. People in the county are okay with that, so you would be fine to do so. Instead of the county folks trying to make it legal in the city, and the city folks trying to make it illegal in the county, you would take a “when in Rome” attitude. Instead of voting at the ballot box, you’d vote with your feet and your wallet. Why legislate when you can migrate?</p>

<p>Migration is actually the way that people historically dealt with persecution. Many of the early American settlers left England because they couldn’t worship as they wished to there. Nowadays, many Americans take it as a point of pride that we can (well, most of us) live cheek-by-jowl with people of different faiths. Certainly this arrangement is nothing to be sneezed at, given the amount of sectarian unrest and violence in the word. However, it has become a sort of American tic to expect our needs to be met no matter where we go, as if the law was something that existed outside of the minds and the hearts of the people under it. This is true whether the cause is access to abortion, concealed carry laws, or gay marriage. Whichever side you are on of any of these issues, the way you feel about them likely doesn’t stop at the county line. Which is probably one reason we have spent the last several generations stuck fighting at the national level about things that would be simply remedied by geography if left at the local level.</p>

<p>Why then, if you are a member of a disadvantaged community in a poor city or a poor state, don’t you simply pick up and move elsewhere? Why don’t we migrate our way out of destitution and division? It is a good question. Certainly many of the conditions that made such movement possible are no longer very common. The first condition is that of safety in numbers. To endure the hardships of migration, both physical, emotional, and economic, it’s good to be in a group. Most of us don’t have a ready-made group (at least one larger than a nuclear family) with whom we’d consider migrating to another town or state. The second reason is that the systems that serve us are location-based: many of us are theoretically free to move, but such a move may come at the cost of our jobs, our benefits, our state disability check. In short, not so free. Even most of our property is immobile: it is not such that we can put it in the back of the wagon and set up camp with along the side of a dusty trail. Finally, even if you had a modern-day caravan ready to move, where would you go to start anew? There are no more territories where you can claim your land grant and start from scratch. Your migration has very little chance of being able to find a place empty enough for you to build from the ground up. New developments are the bastion of mall and shopping center companies, not the work of human communities making a fresh start.</p>

<p>Perhaps this explains our confusion, our enflamed rhetoric when we fight to keep American like this, or prevent it from becoming like that. Perhaps we are a country of folks who used to enjoy getting a fire in our bellies and running out to the frontier to let it burn free, but now the frontier is full, so all we are left to do is stand still and argue. If good fences make good neighbors, maybe taking some space, learning to live and let live despite the close quarters, is the cure to the binds of moral conflict.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqrwkiyPsto">A recent NRA video</a> aimed to stoke the flames of its supporters asks the following question: “Are the President’s kids more important than yours?”</p>

<p>If you are an NRA supporter, you’re apparently likely to answer “no.” In which case, what follows will likely upset you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. But, he’s just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security. Protection for their kids… and gun-free zones for ours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to confess that I’m amazed that this ad can manage to construe the term “gun-free zone” as a <em>negative</em>—and do so in well under a minute. And yet, there are plenty of other circumstances in which I’m more than willing to take the same attitude from which this portrayal stems: the one that says that quite often, the law (or the rules) are applied with a foolish inequality. For example, this is precisely how I feel when I’m taking my shoes off and my bagged liquids out at the airport — I’m not, nor are any of my fellow travelers, terrorists, and yet here we are, wasting time and money being presumed as such until panned and scanned. (Spreading my legs and raising my arms in that scanner, the pose struck me as an odd combination of criminal and stripper — neither role one I’d previously associated with air travel.)</p>

<p>Anyway, keeping that frustration in mind, one can (perhaps) understand the attitude of Suzanna Hupp, a survivor of a gun masacre in 1991 in Killeen, Texas. Not only did Ms. Hupp lose both of her parents at the hands of the gunman, George Jo Hennard, she lives everyday with the feeling that, if it hadn’t been for her reluctance to break the law, she might have stopped him. She recounts to Robin Young on <a href="http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/01/22/suzanna-hupp-guns">NPR’s <em>Here and Now</em></a> her thoughts as the gunman broke through the ceiling-to-floor window of Luby’s Cafeteria and then started shooting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were waiting for some sort of an explanation, like “Everyone put your wallets up on the table” or something along those lines. Remember, these shootings weren’t happening in a random way back then. […] It took a good 45 seconds for me to realize that this guy was just going to walk around and execute people. […] And when I did realize it, I thought, “I’ve got him, I’ve got this guy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robin Young: And you thought that because what?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because for several years I carried a gun in my purse, at that time illegally in the state of Texas. I had a patient when I was in Houston who was an Assistant DA, and he actually convinced me to carry one illegally. So I figured, ‘I’ve got this guy.’ But then I realized a few months earlier, I had made one of the stupidest decisions of my life. My gun was out in my car, 100 yards away, completely useless to me, because I’d wanted to obey the law. I figured, what are the odds of my needing a gun in a crowded place in the middle of the day?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Had Ms. Hupp been fortunate enough to spend her life on the good side of those odds, she might have figured a law that makes it illegal to carry weapons in most public places indeed makes sense. But one can easily see why that afternoon had the effect it did, and turned her against the law: “The only thing the law did,” she explains to Ms. Young, “was prevent <em>me</em> from being able to carry a weapon to protect myself. And as time went on, I found out that there were a dozen other people in there who had weapons out in the car, and had they been allowed to carry them in, might still be alive today.”</p>

<p>Although some would argue that the presence of other armed people may not have necessarily improved the outcome, certainly the image of up to a dozen folks drawing their guns does alter the scenario, and maybe reduce the carnage. Certainly Ms. Hupp is accurate in her assessment of the effect of a gun in one man’s hands in the middle of a room: “he has complete control over the situation.” As she describes how her father attempted to rush the gunman and was shot and killed in so doing, she makes a convincing case for the idea that, truly, the only remedy for a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with one, too. Indeed, when police arrived, a shot to the ceiling was enough to scare the shooter toward a back bathroom area, where, after a brief exchange of fire between him and the officers, he put a bullet in his own head.</p>

<p>If the now-familiar shooting spree is indeed not about robbery or revenge, but truly about the a mad rush of powerfulness that such killing apparently supplies to the shooter, Ms. Hupp’s strategy is to deprive the would-be shooter of the dominance that secures his thrill. “What angers me,” she says, “is that these creeps always go where they know they can shoot people like fish in a barrel.” In short, these rampagers are counting on — and taking devastating advantage of — the tendency of people to obey the law not to carry guns to the mall, to school, to church, etc.</p>

<p>As long as this fact remains true, it will always be open season on Americans, wherever and whenever. Indeed, Ms. Hupp accepts the horrid deaths of her parents with a fierce stoicism, her anger directed not at the shooter but at the law. To be angry at the shooter, she said, “would be like being angry at a rabid dog.”  I suppose it goes without saying that one doesn’t get angry at a rabid dog—or, for that matter, as a liberal might, stand around discussing what in its upbringing caused it to veer off the course of normal, socially-responsible dog life, and then why it was legally allowed to order that Uzi off the Internet. One just shoots it.</p>

<h3 id="roe-roe-roe-your-boat">Roe, Roe, Roe Your Boat</h3>
<p>Tuesday marked the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> that legalized abortion nationwide (by overturning as unconstitutional Texas’s criminal abortion statute). If the initial impetus toward decriminalizing abortion came in large part from the medical establishment, it is the political sphere that has taken the issue to the forefront of American minds in the intervening decades. [Blame Nixon] (http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/01/22/169637288/roe-v-wade-turns-40-but-abortion-debate-is-even-older?ft=1&amp;f=1070): in 1972, he was advised by his strategists to come out against abortion in a bid to lure northern Catholic voters to the Republican side—despite the fact that Republicans (including Nixon himself) had previously been more in favor of abortion rights than Democrats.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2013, and you see the Texas legislature’s <a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/pregnant-scared-can-they-help/">latest ventures in pro-childbirth policies</a>. (Really, the idea that you can’t be in favor of ‘life’ when you favor the right to let women decide to terminate a pregnancy reduces the notion of life to just that of making babies — and while babies are cute and all, they are not the sum total of life. So let’s call being against abortion what it really is: being pro-childbirth.) In addition to passing a sonogram requirement and a 24-hour-wait law for women seeking termination, it now funds (to the tune of $4.15 million in taxpayer money) crisis pregnancy centers: non-medical facilities that provide Christian-based (and -biased) materials to push abstinence as birth control and to persuade women to choose parenthood or adoption over abortion. Indeed, they are contracted by the state to do the latter under the state’s Alternatives To Abortion Program, an initiative modelled on a similar one in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>There are certainly plenty of circumstances in which the state may decide to have a vested interest in promoting childbirth; falling birthrates and the resulting skewed demographics are a significant worry of Japan, Germany, and other countries. What is curious in the Texas situation is that such a demographic interest is absent, and yet the promotion of childbirth seems to have replaced the supposed original goal of reducing the number of abortions performed — a goal with which even pro-choice advocates feel comfortable (recall the “safe, legal, and rare” motto of the Clinton presidency). And yet, these crisis pregnancy centers pointedly eschew the most obvious way to lower the demand for abortion: lowering the rate of unwanted pregnancies. Which, <em>pace</em> the religious right, is not achieved by talking up chastity but by making birth control freely and widely available. (You ever hear that joke about how if men got pregnant, birth control would be in the water supply, like floride?)</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/leeches-lye-and-spanish-fly.html">an op-ed piece</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>, author Kate Manning describes the historical methods that women have used to terminate their pregnancies, usually alone, and usually at considerable risk to themselves. She draws an important lesson from this consistent “willingness” to attempt abortion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Women’s historical willingness to endure horrible dangers, to submit to extreme and prolonged pain, to risk grave injury and death rather than remain pregnant, tells us something important about female desperation and determination, and the price women were—and still are—willing to pay to control their own bodies. What it tells us is that women will always find ways to end an unwanted pregnancy, no matter what the law says, no matter the risks to themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to consider the abortion question from the standpoint of control, as opposed to, say, the standpoint of consequences. In previous centuries, a pregnancy might well carry other burdens in addition to the child: it was proof of sexual activity, which itself constituted, in many historical contexts, immoral conduct. (In certain places in the world today, it still does.) But this American age of the crisis pregnancy center is a far cry from the young, unwed women sent away to deliver babies in secret: now, when <a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/pregnant-scared-can-they-help/">a thirteen-year-old</a> shows up in Abilene, Texas, she’s blithely told that she’s already a mommy, and that adoption is the most unselfish thing she could ever do for her child. Although she’ll be encouraged to remain abstinent if she wants to avoid future unplanned pregnancies (it’s 100% effective, you know), she’ll never be told that she’s a slut or a sinner for having a baby before she’s old enough to legally drive. And while I don’t want her to be told she’s either, I do want her to be told that she can have sex without the risk of pregnancy. I can understand why abortion opponents believe in preventing each and every abortion; they are, in their minds, saving a life and preventing the commission of a grave sin. But what I cannot understand is why this compassion stops short of counseling a clearly sexually active teenager about birth control: what possible goal, other than the promotion of the extreme view that all non-procreative sex is immoral, is served by increasing the likelihood that this teenage mom will once again become pregnant?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is difficult for decidedly pro-childbirth people to imagine the enduring vehemence with which many women, in all centuries, have decided, for whatever individual reasons, against the desirability of bearing a particular child at a particular time. But if what Ms. Manning suggests is true — and it seems indeed reasonable — then we must come to terms with the fact that the concept of the unwanted pregnancy is as real and valid as its counterpart: the planned and much-hoped-for birth. Ms. Manning posits abortion as an age-old solution to a timeless female experience, arguing that a woman’s impulse to control her reproductivity has existed — and will exist — regardless of the law, just as her urge to bear children and raise a family will also surely continue.</p>

<h3 id="write-to-life">Write to Life</h3>
<p>A recent Pew Forum poll](http://www.pewforum.org/Abortion/roe-v-wade-at-40.aspx)reports that American public opinion on this issue has not shifted significantly in the the last twenty years; over that time, support for maintaining the legal situation established by <em>Roe</em> remains around 60%. If anything, what has changed over this time is the awareness of the court decision itself as a landmark in the abortion debate: less than half (44%) of the under 30 crowd polled correctly associated <em>Roe v. Wade</em> with the issue of abortion (33% of respondents answered incorrectly, 24% did not know). This forgetting of the prehistory of <em>Roe</em> has potentially dangerous consequences: many people who are, for entirely legitimate reasons, opposed to abortion, may not realize the physical harm that came to women who, before legalization, sought the procedure or attempted it upon themselves. Indeed, the pro-life movement is rather disingenuous in overlooking this history, considering that a key aspect of their current argument against abortion is <a href="http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/myths/index.html">the (medically inaccurate) positing of physical and psychological harm</a> as a result of abortion. Here’s an exchange on <a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/2328133365">the PBS Newshour</a>between Nancy Keenan of NARAL Pro-Choice America and Charmaine Yoest of Americans United for Life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>KEENAN: [50:40] Women think about this. They understand the complexity of it. They know what their decision is because it’s their life, their story. And I think that’s where the disconnect is: who do you trust? who decides? There’s the million dollar question: who decides — does she or the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>YOEST: [50:55] Women feel betrayed by an abortion industry that has put money and profits over women’s health. There are over a dozen clinics that are being investigated today across this country for unsafe, unsanitary conditions, and the abortion lobby does everything they can, everything they can, to keep from having common-sense regulations put in place. We regulate veterinary clinics better than we do abortion clinics in this country, and that’s outrageous. That is not serving American women, and American women are the ones who are speaking up and saying “enough”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I do not doubt that there are women who have lived to regret their abortions, it is due to the legalization that more of them <em>do</em> live instead of dying in back alleys or kitchen tables from coat-hanger abortions. Yoest’s implication that <em>Roe</em> has betrayed women and has created an unregulated “industry” is, frankly, laughable. Not only does such talk obscure the point that her organization is against abortion, period, no matter how safe or regulated, it also posits women as mere victims of some unspecified force that promotes abortions, rather than as individuals who want to, and do, make that decision and take the responsibility for it.</p>

<p>As the handful of people who read my blog know, I spend an inordinate amount of time exploring the strange and tenuous connections in my mind between things that, on the surface, don’t suggest themselves as related. In this case, what fascinated me is the notion of responsibility within these two narratives sketched above by Ms. Hupp and Ms. Yoest. In the first case, Ms. Hupp’s comparison of the shooter Mr. Hennard to a rabid dog deprives him of all moral agency, and shifts the moral emphasis to her own status as a defenseless victim. What this shift regrettably short circuits is the social consideration that typically follows questions of immoral behavior by people: the fact that we might use regulation to possibly keep guns out of his hands or provide mental health care to possibly discourage his crime. In the second case, Ms. Yoest would rather cast women who abort as victims of “industry,” rather than confront the fact that there are (and have always been) women who really do want to—and do—end their pregnancies without serious moral qualm or significant regret. They are choosing, unapologetically, a what nearly a majority of Americans (47%) view, for themselves personally anyway, as <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Abortion/roe-v-wade-at-40.aspx">a morally reprehensible action</a>. To not consider the validity of female agency in this decision is to remain unable to address it properly from a public health perspective, simply because what one believes for oneself is not, nor has even been, a sufficient means for determining the rules under which a given society will live.</p>

<p>I am very much aware here that the discussion of these two issues in close conjunction abuts a very slippery slope; many would be only too ready to see in my own argument an implied comparison between women who abort and rampage killers. I want to be clear, however, that my interest in this case is not to perform a moral analysis of any sort. Indeed, my interest is not really political at all, but creative, and in the creative consequences for narratives whose authors and/or characters have difficulty confronting the notion of responsibility in problematic contexts—which, let’s be honest, are really the only kinds of contexts in which it is worthwhile to tell stories.</p>

<p>In his essay “Dysfunctional Narratives: or: ‘Mistakes Were Made,” <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Burning-Down-House-Essays-Fiction/dp/1555975089/">Charles Baxter</a> blames none other than Richard Nixon for inaugurating an era of responsibility-avoiding discourse, a cultural of disavowal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have been living in a political culture of disavowals. Disavowals follow from crimes for which no one is capable of claiming responsibility. Mistakes and crimes tend to create narratives, however, and they have done so from the time of Greek tragedies. How can the contemporary disavowal movement not affect those of us who tell stories? We begin to move away from fiction of protagonists and antagonists into another mode, another model. It is hard to describe this model but I think it might be called the fiction of finger-pointing, the fiction of the quest for blame. It often culminates with a scene in a court of law.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In such fiction, people and events are often accused of turning the protagonist into the kind of person the protagonist is, usually an unhappy person. That’s the whole story. When blame has been assigned, the story is over. […] Look at <em>Montel Williams</em>, or <em>Oprah.</em>… For all the variety of the situations, the unwritten scripts are often similar.  Someone is testifying because s/he’s been hurt by someone else. The pain-inflicter is invariably present and accounted for onstage, and sometimes this person admits, abashedly, to inflicting the ruin: cheating, leaving, abusing, or murdering. Usually, however, there’s no remorse or shame. Some other factor caused it: bad genes, alcoholism, drugs, or—the cause of last resort—Satan…. The dramatis personae… generally will not say that they did what they did because they wanted to, or because they had <em>decided</em> to do it. The story is shocking. You hear gasps. But the participants are as baffled and as bewildered as everyone else. So we have the spectacle of utterly perplexed villains deprived of their villainy. Villainy, properly understood, gives someone a largeness, a sense of scale. It seems to me that this sense of scale has probably abandoned us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Baxter writes about craft in a way I never thought possible until I read him; but when he sums up his interest as “issues that in the broadest sense have to do with the imagination’s grip on daily life,” I suddenly understood that my blog has always been more to me than a repetitive liberal screed, obsessing about the issues of same-sex marriage, abortion, and violence in society. Always, and now more than ever, it is my own attempt to work out the relationship between this present American moment and my own imaginative work.</p>

<p>There are probably writers who simply write, who take the story and run, but I am (apparently) a writer who needs also to write about writing, and to wonder about the function of creativity in public and private contexts. It is my goal to write more, and to write better, but I also want to write more knowingly, more conscious of the possibilities of different ways of writing, and how those possibilities relate to this historical-imaginative moment, and my own position in it. The pot of gold is the stories, but the exploration of my imagination is the rainbow.</p>

<p>So Mitt Romney lost, and the only people surprised were me and the conservative media establishment, the former who had feared Romney’s victory, the latter who had predicted it. While the facile philosophy of “you can do anything if you just try hard enough” is still common enough pablum fed to schoolchildren in our idealist quest to believe in the equality of opportunity in an increasingly obviously unequal society, it’s another thing to construct a right-wing propaganda machine disguised as a journalistic empire—and then start to believe the spin you’re trying to sell to everyone else.</p>

That’s not a mandate, guys, that’s a foregone conclusion.</p>

<h3 id="overexposed">Overexposed</h3>
<p>While it hasn’t been confirmed whether the heir and the spare are on their way together, it has been announced, to the delight of many, that The Duchess of Cambridge is now expecting. While it is the destiny of all members of the royal family to be hounded by the media, one can only imagine the digital record that will be created around the life of this next little prince or princess. While perhaps living in the public eye from an early age is an appropriate element of training for a life of public service, I am tempted to believe that privacy is fundamental to the sound development of our fragile egos. We need the safety of solitude, the protections of family and intimate relationships, in order to cope with our many imperfections — in order to learn to bear them, and ourselves, with grace. I may tease my mother about not being on Facebook, but on the other hand, I’m glad I can’t go back and see what she posted when I lost my first tooth.</p>

<p>Forgiveness, especially self-forgiveness, is like a muscle, and I think of privacy as the gym where we strengthen it. This way, when we experience one of life’s unfortunate faceplants in front of the world, we can get up, dust ourselves off, and move forward, rather than succumbing to shame or sadness. While the details are scarce, I imagine that this is what happened, unfortunately, to the poor nurse at King Edward VII Hospital, Jacintha Saldanha, who apparently took her own life after an embarrassing episode at work.</p>

<p>Apparently, while the Duchess was being treated for extreme morning sickness, Saldanha had the misfortune of answering a prank call from two Australian disc jockeys who impersonated the Queen and Prince Charles in order to obtain information about Kate Middleton. She transfered the call, apparently, to a nurse directly involved in the Duchess’s care. The following day, she took her own life.</p>

<p>As Allison Pearson observes in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/allison-pearson/9745539/Jacintha-a-caring-innocent-caught-in-the-crossfire.html"><em>The Telegraph</em></a>, her suicide very likely would not have happened had Saldanha been able to soothe her shame away in the comfort of her family — but she lived in London for work, while her husband and children were in Bristol.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘I’ve done the most terrible thing,’ she could have said to her husband, Ben Barboza. A solid, dependable accountant, he would have reassured his wife that it wasn’t her fault. The hospital would understand. Besides, there were far worse things than being duped by a pair of Aussie prats. Jacintha’s two teenage children would have been getting ready for school, snatching up toast, bags and coats. Their beloved faces would have reminded their mother that, however humiliated or upset she felt, it wasn’t the end of the world. We make mistakes and, yet, life goes on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, life does go on, and Jacintha’s life very likely would have gone on to include a call from the Duchess herself, expressing her sympathies. After all, a woman whose breasts have been spread all over the world as paparazzi fodder could have nothing other than compassion for a woman feeling the shame of overexposure.</p>

<h3 id="doomsday-blues">Doomsday Blues</h3>
<p>So the world didn’t end today — although it appears that at least one person has had his brains attacked and occupied by zombies. That man is Wayne LaPierre, who today <a href="http://current.com/groups/news-blog/93998035_word-cloud-nra-ceo-lapierres-statement-full-text.htm">gave a response</a> to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings that set a new standard for its cultural ignorance and political tone-deafness.</p>

<p>LaPierre first ran through the standard litany of old-school conservative complaints that blamed the entire situation on liberals: 1) there an unknown number of crazy, evil people out there (because liberals refuse to let us make a national database of the mentally ill); 2) there isn’t enough law enforcement (because liberals are soft on crime); and 3) there is a “callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people” — liberal Hollywood.</p>

<p>But the CEO saved the best part for last: the proposal for the federal government to pay for an armed security guard in every school in America. Never mind the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/12/21/cop_in_every_school_how_much_would_wayne_lapierre_s_proposal_cost.html">estimated cost of $5.5 billion</a> (maybe a gun tax to pay for it?), what do you want to bet that one of those “good” guns harms someone before it prevents harm to someone? Even if we could predict or guarantee the efficacy of such an initiative, do you want your children seeing a guy (or gal) with a gun every single schoolday of his or her life? (Wait, is this a secret recruitment tool for the NRA? Hmm…)</p>

<p>The thing is, as eager as LaPierre is to call simulated violence (in movies, videogames, etc.) the “filthiest form of pornography,” he’s as caught up in its spell as any of the people he disparages for making or enjoying gun violence in entertainment. (And by the way, the English watch the same movies and play the same video games we do, but don’t suffer nearly the same rate of gun violence.) The only difference with LaPierre’s obsession is that he’s the hero, rather than the villain. And this, too, is a deep trend in American culture — our military is the best armed in the world, and we are consistently instructed to consider all our troops as heroes, not just service members. Heroes and guns are as linked today as villains and guns. As the Boy Scout motto went, “be prepared.”</p>

<p>And so we are reminded that no one, not even a culture’s critics, are outside of it. We <em>all</em> belong to the American cultural moment of the rampage shooting — people like me, who recognize that gun violence may take my life or the life of someone I know at anytime, anywhere, and those like LaPierre, who feel safe because they have a gun, too. (I wouldn’t want a gun, and I wouldn’t feel safer having one.) Put simply, I’m the person who ignores the video game, and LaPierre is — don’t let all his criticism fool you! — the one who wants to play it.</p>

<p>As the above graphic indicates, I’ve been keeping my eyes peeled for quite a while now. Yesterday, I decided it was time to avert my eyes for a while; nor will I renew my membership in the Modern Language Association, the professional organization for professors and scholars in English and foreign languages and literature. After 10 years, I’ve proven to myself that while I would have gladly accepted — and probably would have enjoyed, and thrived at — a full-time position as a professor, I cannot bring myself to pursue the profession with the single-mindedness the current job market demands. Call me naive, but I got my Ph.D. because I thought it would lead rather naturally to a job for which by temperament and training I was suited. It turns out that the degree resembled the kind of parking permits sold by the University where I got it — a license to hunt, but not a guaranteed space.</p>

<h3 id="jobs-jobs-jobs">Jobs, Jobs, Jobs</h3>
<p>Much of the discussion this election — if we can characterize the relentless stream of negative ads as a discussion — has been about which party has the better plan to generate jobs, which in a bad economy becomes a synonym for the starry-eyed, gilded American concept of <em>opportunity</em>. Americans, arguably, are unique in their obsession with the virtue of hard work; perhaps it is the importance of pioneering in the creation of the country that has given us this instinctive association between deservingness and willingness to work. Never mind that Romney’s income is certainly not commensurate with his mental efforts or talents; the sheer amount of his wealth alone seems to induce a magical thinking according to which he believes that he possesses some innate ability to ease the nation’s employment woes. And even with Obama’s (projected) reelection, a sizable bunch of people have voted for a ticket obsessed with the idea that success is a correlate of one’s efforts, and for that reason, any sort of social safety net is a handout for slackers.</p>

<p>Four years ago, when Virginia went blue in a presidential election for the first time in over a generation, a Republican crony named Virgil Goode lost his cushy seat in the House of Representatives. Although the freshman Democrat who rode Obama’s coattails to Washington, Tom Perriello, could not hang on to his seat in the midterm elections, Goode was gone for good — almost. His name appeared on today’s ballot in 26 states as the presidential candidate for the Constitution Party. A central plank of Goode’s platform is to restrict legal immigration until unemployment falls below 5%, an idea that makes me chuckle when I think of the bias in my own profession toward native Italian speakers. Arguably, I could benefit from Goode’s proposal, but — the tinge of racism/xenophobia aside — I know better than to fall for the simplemindedness of such a jaded theory of prosperity. To believe that in order to create prosperity you need to restrict the competition is to succumb to no less a magical type of thinking than Mitt Romney’s conviction in his ability to “restore” America: both want to flip a switch and change outcomes.</p>

<p>I will be the first to admit that I didn’t ‘play the game’ of academia as heartily as I could have; I only understood that it <em>was</em> a game well into the late innings. But I also know that so much of life is a fielder’s choice — not every advancement or setback is a referendum on your qualifications or performance.</p>

<h3 id="canvassed">Canvassed</h3>
<p>As part of my two-hour chilly stroll though a part of my voting precinct, I visited a public housing development. It was located (obviously) within walking distance from my house, and although I drive the nearby thoroughfare regularly, I’d never seen it up close. Quite honestly, I don’t think I even knew it was there.</p>

<p>As a confirmed liberal, I absolutely see the value of providing subsidized housing for those who cannot, for whatever reason, earn enough to afford adequate housing at market rates. There is certainly an argument to be made that such assistance will take away an incentive for self-advancement; however, given that, as Jesus said, “the poor you will always have with you,” (Matt. 26:11) it is arguably more farsighted (not to mention more compassionate) to not let self-reliance be the sole safeguard between our fellow citizens and slumlords.</p>

<p>I admit to a feeling of separation; there are surely two Americas, or perhaps many Americas, divided along the invisibile lines of ideology and the far more visible ones of income. But separation is not systematic; it is idiosyncratic. On a tucked-away street I’d never been down, I found a beautifully updated house, complete with spiffy front garden and stained glass windows, right next to the most wretchedly run-down property. At this latter house, a woman who hadn’t been reached on the first canvas pass opened the door, and assured me that not only were she and her husband voting for Obama, another person who had canvassed was picking them up and taking them to the polls. It was one of just a handful of contacts I’d made in my two hours, and there was of course no way to know if any of them would make a difference. But of course I didn’t agree to volunteer with the expectation of making a difference with such a minimal time commitment. I did it for reasons that can only be described as idiosyncratic.</p>

<p>My initial plan was to vote this morning, but in the end I was too concerned that the pre-work rush would prevent me from showing up for my final training shift at my new job. So I walked up to the polling place around 2pm or so, and ended up standing around outside the school a bit as I wrapped up a phone conversation I was having with my dad. While we chatted, I saw my next-door neighbors exit the polling place and head homeward. I stepped out to the sidewalk to greet them; we greeted each other warmly, and, as if in a subconscious throwback to an earlier point in the century, we shook hands.</p>

<p>My neighbors, who live in a modest ranch house nearly identical to mine, are wonderful folks; the wife is vivacious and sweet, and her husband has generously helped me with several yard projects. The fact that they are immigrants from El Salvador does not render them, in my mind, any less American than myself. This is as it should be, but it may not be an attitude that comes naturally to everyone. And while one could chalk up my attitude  to a decidedly liberal upbringing in a liberal enclave of an already-liberal state, I am more inclined, at this point in my life, to account for it by a personal awareness of the sheer unpredictability of life experience. My family has given me every possible advantage in life: unconditional love, unparalleled education, financial security. And yet life is nonetheless often challenging, and regularly unfair. Personally, I don’t think being an American is solely about any of the buzz words so fetishized by presidential campaigns: success, opportunity, or hard work. I think it’s about plain random luck, and sheer chance: the luck to be born on our soil, the chance that one takes in leaving one’s birth nation for foreign shores. To bend an old saying toward our point: America is what happened while a bunch of old white men were busy making other plans.</p>

<p>Go Obama!</p>

<h3 id="back-to-school">Back to School</h3>
<p>Fall is in the air, and the coolness after a fairly lush summer make for a gloriously verdant few weeks, a miraculous interregnum between the miserable humidity of August and the changing colors and darker days of full-blown autumn.</p>

<p>Although I still teach on the semester schedule that has regulated the majority of my years, it no longer has the same internal pull that it once did. After many years of the academic lifestyle, work knows no season for me now. Thus the association between fall and renewal now comes more from the Jewish New Year and the refreshing break in East Coast summer heat.</p>

<p>This fall also marks an important juncture in a project I understood at the beginning of this calendar year: the reading of the entire Holy Bible. The Jewish Bible (even minus the Apocrypha) is so much longer than what Christians call the New Testament that, in a year’s reading, you don’t even come to the Gospels until the final day of September.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, I have been entirely underwhelmed by my reading of the Bible so far. I’ve committed to doing it because I feel that it is unconscionable to be as “educated” as I am and <em>not</em> have read the Bible, but I can’t say that I’ve gotten very much out of this initial encounter. The Jewish Bible is an easy book to read, but a very difficult book to understand. It is from a time that feels terribly remote; the beautiful moments that stand out are few and far between. I confess to doing a lot of skimming.</p>

<p>The Oxford Annotated Bible, the edition of the Good Book that I’m reading, explains in its introduction to the New Testament that “a more appropriate word than ‘testament’ to designate the character of these books is ‘covenant,’” since what is new is specifically the agreement that God makes with his people. As described in the prophecy of Jeremiah, the nature of this shift is from the laying down of the law to the laying upon of hands, from a learning from without to an awareness from within — from a presence among the Chosen People to the essence within every person.</p>

<p>As I read the first book of Luke, the only Gospel that contains the beautiful story of the Annunciation, I tried to imagine Mary as a good Jewish girl, demure, literate, and ready to go with the flow with the predictions of angels. It’s a strange sort of literary Gedankenexperiment, but it feels appropriate to my own situation, as I attempt to recast myself in my own story — by going back to school to study, at last, my first passion: writing.</p>

<h3 id="celebrations">Celebrations</h3>
<p>Last weekend I went to a wedding between two young and beautiful people (the bride is a family friend whose birth I am old enough to recall). It was the first trip to the Hamptons on Long Island for both my parents and myself, where we managed to continue an unfortunate family tradition of ending up (at least the first night) in miserable accommodations. (The last time this happened, at my cousin’s wedding in London, we actually moved hotels; this time we merely moved rooms.) Anyway, the overall trip was lovely, and the wedding was spectacular: beautiful setting, poignant ceremony, plenty to drink, wonderful food, and — best of all — great music and dancing.</p>

<p>Men aren’t commonly taught to partner dance these days, and my father probably only learned because he grew up ice skating, and his years on the rink included a period of dancing, often with his mother as his partner. It’d been years since my father and I had danced together, and for legitimate reasons, I’d thought my father’s dancing days were behind him. And yet he was in great form that night, and we cut a rug together, enjoying equally the dancing and the amazement that, after everything that has happened in the last few years, we <em>could</em> dance.</p>

<p>Over a decade ago, the father of the bride suffered a massive heart attack, and in the subsequent trauma, suffered significant brain damage and memory loss. Physically, he recovered, but emotionally, psychologically, and intellectually, he was (and is) no longer the same person. It was a tragedy, and yet his wife’s commitment never wavered, and she never let the new challenges of their life stop her from living. She retired as planned, and the two of them travel frequently. The result of too much pre-dinner liquor, I asked her through tears how she had done it, telling her how much I had always admired her. She smiled and said that she didn’t know; all she knew was that he was her husband, and that you don’t always get everything you want in life. And while that is most certainly true, and while most of us muster the perseverance to survive, fewer are blessed by the grace of acceptance, by which I mean the deep knowledge that, truly, things could not have been any different. It was this grace that the mother’s inability to explain ‘how’ exuded; watching the bride boogie with her father to the song I knew she had played constantly as she waited for him to come out of his coma, I felt confident that this grace was upon her daughter as well.</p>

<h3 id="believe-in-yourself">Believe in… yourself</h3>
<p>The four people who read this blog know that I usually write about politics. Part of me really wanted to write about how outraged I was about what Romney said last week on 60 Minutes when asked about the problem of the uninsured in America. Instead of taking credit for the ahead-of-the-curve solution he helped engineer in Massachusetts, Romney rambled off the pathetic fact that, if you go to an emergency room in this country, no one is turned away because of the lack of an inability to pay.</p>

<p>I could go on and on about how stupid and insensitive this remark is — and how it was this exact problem that motivated the solution-oriented Governor himself to favor, once upon a time, the personal mandate — which is, as well all know, at the heart of what we now call RomneyCare. I could analyze that remark as revealing Romney’s deep down disdain for people who don’t make enough money not to need insurance — we are freeloaders who want handouts, and so what more could we want than to go to the emergency room when we are desperate and not have to pay a dime!</p>

<p>I have grown to genuinely dislike Mitt Romney over the past few months, although I’ll be content to forget about both him and my animus as soon as it is confirmed that he will indeed not win the presidential race. My fear about a Romney victory has lately given way to a bit of schadenfreude regarding his campaign. Mitt really sucks at running for office, and when the guy who sucks is on the other team, one can get a little glib about it.</p>

<p>Romney suffers from a common bewilderment that besets an overall successful person when he tries to do something he’s simply terrible at. Romney, by all accounts, is an affable, compassionate, and intelligent guy. The guy you’d want making the presentation or closing the deal when it comes to business. He’s smart, polished, unfailingly polite. He has a record of success (in business, in church, in family life), and probably believes that he should be good at whatever he sets out to do.</p>

<p>A different man probably would have quit by now, but it’s important to remember that Romney’s faith in himself echoes his Mormon faith — his conviction doesn’t waver no matter how unconvincing his pitch proves to others. (In France, on his Mormon mission, Romney apparently didn’t convert a single person.) Indeed, as we can see from the latest real Romney secret video moment, Mitt doesn’t even want to try to convince those who aren’t wealthy enough to be motivated by lower federal tax rates to vote for him.</p>

<p>This rare kind of conviction — half justified self-esteem, half well-practiced blind faith — is probably as good as explanation as any as to why Romney can essentially reverse his position on any given issue and still believe that he, well, believes anything at all. Heck, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=160879686">if God can change his mind about black people</a> [follow the link and search for “Before we go any further”, then read from there] certainly Romney can change his mind about a personal mandate and gay rights, no?</p>

<p>After all, he’s a Mormon, and dang it, a Mormon just believes.</p>

<p>Now, reality has left the building, leaving only an empty chair and a rambling actor to put words in its mouth. I’m not talking about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/us/politics/ryans-speech-contained-a-litany-of-falsehoods.html">pink slip Paul Ryan gave to the truth</a> this convention, or <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/what-war_651279.html">Romney’s failure to pay even lip service</a> to the ongoing war in Afganistan in his acceptance speech. While both of those distortions are <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-august-30-2012/rnc-2012---the-road-to-jeb-bush-2016---we-can-change-that">understandable from the point of view of political expediency</a>, the truly mind-blowing bit is Clint Eastwood’s announcement that he moved to tears by the “disgrace” of America’s 23 million unemployed.</p>

<p>This figure is, regrettably, accurate. The reality-bending parts are: 1) that this is a Hollywood actor announcing this at the <em>Republican</em> National Convention; 2) that the charge levied against the Obama administration is that it hasn’t done enough to address the situation; and 3) that the GOP’s idea of a government solving the unemployment problem is precisely NOT for the government to stimulate the economy or create jobs. By that logic, the fact that the Democrats have been prevented from passing more stimulus and/or employment bills by the obstruction-crazed House Republicans should be prompting praise from the GOP! Look! We’re getting our way! We’re preventing Obama from not solving this problem through government intervention! Vote for us and we’ll solve this problem by… doing more of the same?</p>

<p>If Clint Eastwood had stopped at his suggestion that “it may be time for somebody else to come along and solve the problem,” he would have fulfilled his promise to speak for three minutes and have delivered, if not a terribly convincing endorsement of Romney, at least a heartfelt one. Instead, Eastwood launches into his rambling pretend interview with the President, talking about Obama’s failure to close Gitmo, his initial attempt to try suspected terrorists on American soil, his approval of the war in Afghanistan (which Clint seems to imply was a stupid idea, which, of course it was: the stupid idea of Bush fils)—all of this interspersed with implied insults from the empty chair, including Obama asking Eastwood to tell Romney to go fuck himself.</p>

<h3 id="uterus-knows-best">Uterus knows best</h3>
<p>While one could construe these references to self-copulation as the staging of the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/fear-of-a-black-president/309064/">Angry Black Man</a> that Barack Obama has never, for obvious reasons, been allowed to be, one could also interpret this most-satisfying of physically impossible insults as a revealing metaphor of the Republican Party’s body-centered notion of America’s fate and its current frustrations. America, the glorious body that the GOP want desperately to redeem, contains the very forces that have led to its iniquities. Thus the party is compelled to both praise and blame, driven to extol an American greatness that is eternal yet at the same time gravely threatened.</p>

<p>The comparison between a nation and a body (usually female) is at least as old as the Old Testament, and certainly the GOP has no shortage of things to say about the female body, including Representative Todd Akin’s now-infamous <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/opinion/the-medieval-roots-of-todd-akins-theories.html">belief in mental birth control</a>. Putting aside its inaccuracy and its denial of the most basic personal rights to women, what better metaphor could there be to express the hopes of the GOP: America can remain great and pure despite her penetration from outside impurities! Her innate wisdom (thank God!) provides a way of stopping invasive iniquity before she is corrupted. Whether this outside is for you Obama the Kenyan-born, Obama the Muslim, Obama the Black Man, or Obama the Socialist hardly matters: what matters is the concept of adulteration, and while the GOP may not have succeeded at doing anything else in the last 4 years, they have certainly succeeded in branding liberalism as an anathema, something that is not truly American.</p>

While you or I could probably not imagine sharing our body with another person, the Hensel women have known nothing different since birth, and thus make the coordination required for their daily existence look effortless and natural. They are two distinct people, but they often speak in unison or complete the other’s sentences, appearing to know somehow what the other is thinking. The amount of compromise that is necessary for them to have any kind of life is simply astounding – let alone the thriving, dare-I-say ‘normal’ life that this and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel#Media_appearances">previous filmic interventions</a> capture. They are good at compromise not because they are naturally predisposed, but because they have both no choice and also a lifetime of practice.</p>

<p>When they were younger, my mother once suggested that the Hensel twins should be mediators, unique experts on compromise that they are. Instead, the twins are pursuing a career in elementary education, with complete understanding that while they will be doing the job of one person (and thus will, at least initially, receive one salary), they will do it differently than one person would do it, as they have two minds, two degrees, and two perspectives. They are experts at appearing in a world that may not initially know how to interpret or accomodate them, and thus are unlikely to fear the curious eyes and minds of young school children.</p>

<p>To suggest that our political process could learn something from the unique experience of these women would require the dismantling of the one-body-America metaphor that has proven so seductive. After all, not terribly long ago, the image of a woman with two heads, two hearts, two legs, and one reproductive system would have suggested only monstrosity, perversion, unnaturalness. And yet if you see the Hensel twins, you will know that this could not be further from the truth.</p>

<p>On neither the human nor the political body is the normal inherently inscribed. If reality TV is any indication, there are no more freaks; differences are merely marketing opportunities. The GOP used to be the party of the Big Tent, offering a place under the bigtop to all who believed in the principle that less was more; less government intervention meant greater economic productivity and increased resilience of the social fabric. These are honorable ideals, but ranting about the sacred creativity (in the job sense) of small business owners and the need for (still) lower taxes on the already-rich doesn’t seem like an invitation to a circus of acceptance to me.</p>

<p>“We built it,” they cry. The rest of us… can go fuck ourselves.</p>

<p>Early last Friday morning, a 24-year-old man named James Holmes walked into a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, threw canisters of some breath-complicating gas, and opened fire on the audience that had come out to watch the lastest Batman move, <em>The Dark Night Rises</em>. As of XXX, the death toll is 12, but 11 of the nearly 60 people injured are in serious condition.</p>

<p>The reaction to yet another random shooting in a public venue in suburban American has been greeted with the by-now-familiar mix of shock, grief,  general head-shaking and hand-wringing. The President flew back from the campaign trail to Washington so he could play the consoler-in-chief; perhaps stating the obvious (life is precious, uncertain) looks more presidential than stumping against Richie Rich Romney? Personally, I’d rather have better gun control than the President’s heartfelt prayers, but at this point I’m resigned to getting only the former in this country, from a leader of either party.</p>

<p>I do not believe I’m exaggerating when I claim that it could have been all the children of every member of Congress in that theater, and still no one would be calling for a ban on the sale of the weapons whose power we glorify (precisely in films like <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>) but whose consequences we mourn as if a shooting was an act of God as unpreventable as a tornado. Rather, the right will call for all of us to arm ourselves for protection, and the left will wax philosophical about cherishing the moments between the gunshots. (Thank you, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Zhvk6A3kE">Mayor Bloomberg</a>, for actually demanding more than platitudes.)</p>

<p>And, to add insult to all the injuries past, present, and future, everyone will blame the insane. We know shockingly little about James Holmes, a graduate student at the University of Colorado, Denver, who had reportedly been in the process of withdrawing from the neuroscience program there. But already people who had never heard his name before he was arrested in the darkness of the cinema parking lot feel quite comfortable dismissing him as insane.</p>

<p>As inevitably happens in these sorts of incidents, he will be dismissed as disturbed, insane, etc., and his actions will be assigned to his mental problems, rather than to the availability of automatic weapons. Normal civilians, you see, don’t use guns for the purposes they were intended for – and anyone who does use them to kill random people is, by this tautology, not a normal person.</p>

<p>The familiar call to get better background checks to prevent “people with a history of mental illness” from purchasing firearms is  While most mentally ill people are not violent, and while most crimes are committed by the sane, we go out of our way to absolve social circumstances and assign heinous crimes to individual defect. This is of course to be expected in a country obsessed with the notion of personal responsibility, but this argument is predicated on an outrageously false supposed connection between violence and mental illness.</p>

<h3 id="the-longest-war">The longest war</h3>
<p>Last month in <em>The New York Times</em>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/why-cant-we-end-poverty-in-america.html">Peter Edelman penned an op-ed piece about poverty</a>, specifically, about why it has been so difficult to eradicate in America, the wealthiest nation on earth.</p>

<p>Edelman’s diagnosis regarding the persistence of poverty will come as no surprise to liberals: there are too many low-wage jobs, wages in such low-earning jobs remain stagnant, and relief programs that keep people out of poverty (i.e., welfare) have been scaled back or eliminated. Certainly there has been economic growth in recent decades, and even in recent years, but its benefits have been almost exclusively confined to the top income earners, the now infamous 1%.</p>

<p>The attitude behind Edelman’s outlook is that capitalism makes some rich and leaves others poor; the role of government is thus to counteract the latter effect through a redistribution of wealth. From this perspective, poverty is understood intuitively as a negative outcome that society has an obligation to combat.</p>

<p>To the extent that this view presumes that poverty is a matter for the state to address, it is a political view of poverty. But it is not just the supporters of the safety net who fall into this category. Even those who view the New Deal as the disastrous encroachment of the dreaded Welfare State are still thinking politically: they think that political interference <em>promotes</em> poverty by discouraging self-reliance (and by restraining economic growth).</p>

<p>The consequence of this political attitude is that the nature of poverty itself goes unexamined. Nature of poverty, you say? Isn’t that obvious? <em>No one wants to be poor</em>. But this reaction is, I would suggest, the result of such a political attitude rather than its cause. Poverty is presumed to be the proof of bad policy – the policy of the other party, of course—and as such, the state of poverty is presumed to be horrible and unnatural.</p>

<p>Surely, the misery of not being able to meet one’s basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, and medical care is not negligible. But the notion of deprivation can hardly account for the prevailing attitude toward poverty as something to be battled against and defeated. Deprivation and misfortune are as old as human existence itself – much, much older than the view that poverty is eliminable. The constant references in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament to the poor implies (to me, anyway) that poverty was once viewed a mere fact of human existence; the constant monitions and reminders to aid the unfortunate were not political in nature, but entirely social. Aiding the poor was simply a matter of course, as natural as the existence of poor people themselves. In this sense, there was no “poverty,” just as there was no reified notion of “combating poverty.”</p>

<h3 id="malinvestment">Malinvestment</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The question is not whether we wish to see everybody as well off as possible. Among men of good will such an aim can be taken for granted. The real question concerns the proper means of achieving it. And in trying to answer this we must never lose sight of a few elementary truisms. We cannot distribute more wealth than is created. We cannot in the long run pay labor as a whole more than it produces. —Henry Hazlitt, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Economics-One-Lesson-Shortest-Understand/dp/0517548232"><em>Economics in One Lesson</em></a> <em>(ch. XIX, part 3)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of my recovery from blind-faith liberalism, I’m reading books that have me shaking more than nodding my head. One of these is Hazlitt’s classic 1946 primer on laissez-faire Austrian school economics, <em>Economics in One Lesson</em>.</p>

<p>Hazlitt takes us through the many economic regulations we have come to take for granted – tariffs, farm subsidies, government-backed mortgages, unemployment insurance, rent control, minimum wages laws, etc. — and explains (sometimes more, sometimes less convincingly) why they all amount to no more than robbing Peter (the taxpayer) to pay Paul (the unemployed, the poor, the struggling farmer, the nascent industrialist). He calls this kind of misdirection of money “malinvestment.”</p>

<p>Although Hazlitt understands how being out of work can be a personal tragedy for the person and family of the unemployed, he still does not see a real benefit to taking money from other people who are employed (via taxation) and “creating” a job for this person. For Hazlitt, such “make-work” schemes lend the appearance of enriching the nation but actually just divert wealth that could have been spent by individuals rather than the government. Take the example of building an unnecessary bridge with tax dollars.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[F]or every public job created by the bridge project a private job has been destroyed somewhere else. We can see the men employed on the bridge. We can watch them at work.  The employment argument of the government spenders becomes vivid, and probably for most people convincing. But there are other things that we do not see, because, alas, they have never been permitted to come into existence. They are the jobs destroyed by the $10 million taken from the taxpayers. All that has happened, at best, is that there has been a <em>diversion</em> of jobs because of the project. More bridge builders; fewer automobile workers, television technicians, clothing workers, farmers. <em>(ch. IV, part 1)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although you’d have to be naive to believe that America is going to recover from the Great Recession by building more cars (we’re lucky to be building any), repairing TVs (!!), making more clothes, or returning to the farm, the case against government spending that Hazlitt makes here at first appears to be that put forward by Mitt Romney and the Republican Party in their attempt to unseat President Obama this November. Cut taxes, Romney says, and economic prosperity will return – the true “job creators” (capitalists) will go back to hiring. To which the Obama campaign says, “we tried that approach, that’s how we got into this mess!”</p>

<h3 id="les-misérables">Les Misérables</h3>
<p>But there is a crucial difference between Hazlitt’s arguments and Romney’s throwback belief in trickle-down economics—and, once again, it comes down to a political versus a social understanding of poverty.</p>

<p>In the final pages of the book, Hazlitt writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under a system of division of labor… it is difficult to think of a greater fulfillment of any human need which would not, at least temporarily, hurt some of the people who have made investments or painfully acquired skill to meet that precise need. If progress were completely even all around the circle, this antagonism between the interests of the whole community and of the specialized group would not, if it were noticed at all, present any serious problem. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But economic progress never has taken place and probably never will take place in this completely uniform way. […] And if there is a sudden increase in the supply of the thing I help to produce, or if a new invention or discovery makes what I produce no longer necessary, then the gain to the world is a tragedy to me and to the productive group to which I belong. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is altogether proper—it is, in fact, essential to a full understanding of the problem – that the plight of these groups be recognized, that they be dealt with sympathetically, and that we try to see whether some of the gains from this specialized progress cannot be used to help the victims find a productive role elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the solution is never to reduce supplies arbitrarily, to prevent further inventions or discoveries, or to support people for continuing to perform a service that has lost its value. […] This is the insane doctrine of wealth through scarcity. (Ch. XXV, part 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Hazlitt does not discuss the role of charity in the economy, his insistence on the “insanity” of purposefully creating scarcity seems to point in the same direction as the Bible’s instructions on gleaning: namely, toward the necessary allowance of an abundance (or surplus) that cannot — and should not — be regulated. While he may seem to take a harsh line on people put out of work by evolving technology, Hazlitt would also be against paying farmers <em>not to farm</em> in order to prop up the price of crops. In short, Hazlitt believes in the free market not simply because of his faith in prosperity, but also because of his knowledge of tragedy.</p>

<p>Mitt Romney, on the other hand, looks out across the spacious skies and sees only the inevitable prosperity of those waves of grain thwarted by failed Democratic policies. He beholds the busts and bubble-bursts but refuses to see the tragedy at the heart of market-based capitalism that Hazlitt bravely describes. No, Romney sees only the absence of a guiding, invisible hand—his own. In short, he believes in economic magic, a viewpoint (non-coincidentally) <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2011/10/0083637">essential to his Mormon faith</a>—and one that (undoubtedly) has been reinforced by his personal success. (And what Victor Hugo has to say about that!)</p>

<p>Regardless of what you think of supply-side economics, it is Romney’s overactive positive mind that, in my humble opinion, disqualifies him to be President. Give me a tragedian over a magician anytime, as the former is much closer to the <em>misérables</em> in our midst.</p>

<p>Reading the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/nyregion/in-rory-stauntons-fight-for-his-life-signs-that-went-unheeded.html">critical account of the medical decisions</a> in the final days of Rory’s life, one cannot help but be struck by our steadfast belief in modern medicine: no longer do we view one’s survival as a turn of simple good luck; instead, we view death as the result of unfortunate decisions and missed opportunities. In short, we believe that as long as we act appropriately, we can usually prevent death.</p>

<p>When someone young dies, there is always an additional sense of regret for the end of a life that barely had a chance to get off the ground. This metaphor is especially relevant for Rory, who wanted to become a pilot. With timely instruction and training, he might not have been all that far from realizing his dream. It may surprise you to know that many states allow kids to earn a pilot’s licence before they are old enough to drive—Rory found a flight school that accepted students as young as twelve so he could take a flight with an instructor upon what would be his last birthday.</p>

<p>There is something incredibly beautiful about being able to learn as a pre-teen something most of consider too complicated or dangerous to attempt at any age. Flying, despite the commonness (and entirely eroded glamour) of its commercial version, still manages to represent the wonder and daring of youth, the pursuit of the carefree through dedicated practice and application of skill. It captures perhaps like nothing else the blend of childish wonder and almost-adult seriousness, a combination Rory’s very physique—already five-foot-nine and 169 pounds—seemed to embody.</p>

<h3 id="growing-pains">Growing pains</h3>
<p>Recently, David Brooks took <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/opinion/honor-code.html">one of his columns</a>to discuss the social dangers of not letting boys be boys. By now, he points out, the evidence that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Adrift-Epidemic-Unmotivated-Underachieving/dp/0465072100">boys overall are lagging behind girls</a> is incontrovertible: boys’ test scores in reading and writing are far lower than those of girls; the historic advantage they have enjoyed in math and science is almost gone. Boys account for far more discipline problems, and they earn 75% of high school Ds and Fs. Colleges scramble to find enough young men in a more or less hopeless quest to un-skew their gender ratios.</p>

<p>If you were thinking this general male failure to launch has helped women, you’d be wrong. If anything, it has just made the competition among the most educated and motivated of them all the more fierce – while as a group they still bump up against the same glass ceiling in the spheres of business, government, and academia. Meanwhile, for the average, non-Ivy-League-aspiring woman, the lagging performance of men overall constitutes a different kind of burden: it becomes more and more difficult for them to find marriageable men, a fact that has been blamed for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/us/two-classes-in-america-divided-by-i-do.html">startling increase in single motherhood in the last several decades</a>. In short, the collapse of widespread male success is bad for everyone.</p>

<p>While Brooks paints boys as the victims of schools’ rigid expectations that every student be “nurturing, collaborative, disciplined, neat, studious, industrious and ambitious,” boys are  also the target of a much more serious form of abuse. Besides the ongoing revelations about pedophile priests, we have just witnessed the trial of Jerry Sandusky, who was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/sports/ncaafootball/jerry-sandusky-convicted-of-sexually-abusing-boys.html">convicted of sexually assaulting 10 boys</a>. (In all, the jury found him guilty on 45 of the 48 counts in the indictment.)</p>

<p>In a way, though, the deluded Sandusky (listen to the way he talks about his feelings about boys in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xy0L8MUsOE">this surreal interview with Bob Costas</a>, right after the scandal broke) is just the tip of the iceberg of a larger crime, namely the willingness demonstrated by many (assumedly non-pedophiles) in positions of power <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/12/sports/ncaafootball/13pennstate-document.html">to look the other way</a> in order to perserve their own positions in the exploitation ring for fame and profit known as college football. Penn State will likely get a slap on the wrist when they deserve to have the book hurled at them, i.e., <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/07/16/156855045/op-ed-ban-penn-state-football">a multi-year suspension of the football program</a>.</p>

<p>While we may all agree that a grown man raping a boy in a locker room shower is wrong (even if some of us are not willing to act to stop it), it seems that we are stuck when it comes to acknowledging the issue of homosexuality as part of a frank, unprejudiced upbringing in modern society. While you can now be a gay Marine, good luck being a Boy Scout who is struggling with nascent same-sex attraction. After a secretive two-year review, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/us/boy-scouts-reaffirm-ban-on-gay-members.html">private association has decided to retain its policy</a> against any member (Scout or Scout Leader) who is openly gay. While such a policy is fully within the association’s constitutional rights, it seems like a giant step backward for the raising of boys – yet another insistance that they learn to conform, rather than to honestly embrace who they and their peers really are. In the case of the Scouts, rather than the school system, it is the Mormon and Roman Catholic Churches (both large financial supporters of the Boy Scouts) who are attempting to pigeonhole boys into what they find acceptable.</p>

<h3 id="to-write-a-boy">To write a boy</h3>
<p>A classic piece of advice given to writers is “write what you know.” Lately, I have realized how much I am drawn to writing about what remains a mystery to me, sensing that imagination will give me a different but equally important form of understanding.</p>

<p>I was teaching a 3-year-old friend of mine about imagination the other day. Julian (not his real name) is the oldest son of a good friend of mine, and I have known him long enough now to see him go from uttering a few garbled words to carrying on earnest conversations. I was telling him how while the world of things has rules (those of parents as well as those of physics), anything is possible in the world contained within one’s mind.</p>

<p>Being friends with a young child is mostly about being delighted. Surely that’s the purpose of many friendships and romances, but the role of pure enjoyment of the other takes on an added emphasis when you rule out many mainstays of adult conversation: the past, the future, work woes, relationship drama.</p>

<p>Predictably, most of our conversations revolve around the pure joy of learning about the wonderful world of things. Julian already knows the names of more types of lawn and construction equipment than I do, but luckily the farming magazine we are looking at has all sorts of wonders in it (although honestly the mower ads are Julian’s favorite). I tell him about honey, and why the beekeeper who harvests it from the bees has to wear the white suit and a big helmet over his face. We look at fabulous photos of rare kinds of broccoli, and I realize that the world is not new all the time just for three-year-olds, but for me, too.</p>

<p>Julian will likely never remember any of these early times, but it is not any less wonderful or deep of a process for that fact. I have seen him go from shy to gregarious with me, from upset that I take his father away from him to make music to able to wait fairly patiently until we are done so we can “hang out” and “have a chat.” I have watched the hints of his character—smart, curious, willful, excited, helpful, non-covetous—come gradually into sharper relief.</p>

<p>Such is the magic and mystery of boyness, happening right before my eyes.</p>

<p>I shouldn’t brag, but I have power. Electric power. Many in central Virginia still do not, even nearly a week after a rare type of storm, a derecho (from the Spanish “straight ahead”), hit this area last Friday evening. And as many people in the surrounding counties draw their water from wells, no power also means no water. And did I mention that we’re having the hottest weather of the summer so far? In short, it’s a mess of discomfort, damage, and for <a href="http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/Va_Storm_Death_Toll_Rises_to_11_161248715.html">11 unfortunate VA residents</a>, death.</p>

<p>As these events tend to remind us, forewarned does not necessarily inspire us to be forearmed. If you were watching TV or listening to the radio that evening, you would have undoubtedly received the weather warning. But at that point, it may have been too late to do those simple-but-essential preparatory things: fill your gas tank; refresh your emergency supplies, especially water; get your hands on a battery-powered radio and flashlight.</p>

<p>It is not simple ignorance that promotes unpreparedness—anyone who has lived through one east coast summer (or winter) knows that power outages are a seasonal inevitability. Rather, it is our collective blithe spiritedness, our reliance to the point of forgetfulness on the infrastructure of modern America, that leaves us a bit surprised each time the inevitable occurs.</p>

<p>And so we pause. And sweat. The neighborhood men gather and fire up the chainsaws. We use our smart phones to tell everyone on our social networks that we don’t have power. We talk to one another in the uncommon loudness of the breeze and bugs. We sleep in the basement. We lie awake in the moist darkness of the long, hot nights, and think about the options for the freezer: lose it all, or fight back with ice supplies. We go to work for the coolness, to the gym for a shower. We become refugees, off to a friend’s house, whether in town or out of state. Gradually, we find the calm after the storm.</p>

<h3 id="paper-moon">Paper Moon</h3>
<p>Before the derecho, the big storm in Cville was of another kind: <a href="http://www.readthehook.com/104355/ouster-aftermath-timeline-uva-tumult">the massive fallout</a> after the unexpected forced resignation of the president of the University of Virginia, Teresa Sullivan. Out of the blue, Rector Helen Dragas (the head of the Board of Visitors) led a behind-the-scenes effort to secure the votes to oust Sullivan, who, when confronted (on Friday, June 8) by Dragas and (former) Vice-Rector Mark Kington, consented to their request that she resign.</p>

<p>Not since Helen of Troy has a woman of that name wrought so much trouble: from town to gown, everyone was shocked, and a lot of folks were outraged. The outpouring of anger at the Board and support for Sullivan gave a lie to the clichÃ© of a sleepy summer University campus. On the contrary, the Faculty Senate sprang into action, fueling the general impression that the only way out of this sudden mess was a U-turn. And despite the skepticism of some, that’s exactly what happened; on June 26, in a special, live-streamed meeting of the Board of Visitors, all of them—including the by-now-vilified Dragas—<a href="http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/BREAKING_S_160420665.html">voted to reinstate Sullivan</a>. And for those of us who thought the televised love-fest that followed the meeting was just for show, the Governor announced this week that he was <a href="http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/Gov_McDonnell_Announces_UVa_Board_of_Visitors_Appointments_160873065.html">appointing Dragas for a second four-year term</a> on the Board, something one assumes would not have happened if Sullivan had not given her okay.</p>

<p>The origin of this maelstrom was, Dragas claimed, a need for change—large-scale changes at the University that, in turn, required a change at the top. But as was plainly evident in the statement Dragas issued in an attempt at clarification, the items she listed—declining state funding, the constant struggle for revenue, the necessity of considering the final frontier of education, online instruction—<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/education/public-universities-see-familiar-fight-at-virginia.html">were no different than the challenges faced by any large public university</a>. And nowhere was there any explanation about how the much-beloved Sullivan, in under two years at UVa, had demonstrated an unawareness of or inability to meet such challenges.</p>

<p>While it seems clear enough that the current model of accruing massive debt for an undergraduate degree is untenable in the long term, it seems even less likely that high-achieving business types are going to achieve a corporate miracle by hasty personnel change at the top. Sullivan has it right when she warned in <a href="http://www.nbc29.com/story/18817164/first-time-since-outser-sullivan-speaks">her own statement</a> (post-resignation, pre-reinstatement): “Corporate-style, top-down leadership does not work in a great university. Sustained change with buy-in does work.”</p>

<h3 id="undecided">Undecided</h3>
<p>Nationally, the big story this week was the Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. For all the hullabaloo and made-for-cable drama of the Big Day of Decision, the majority ruling itself was fairly pedestrian: Congress is free to pass taxes, and so if Congress wants to assess a penalty tax on those who don’t purchase health care, it’s not for the Court to say otherwise. In short, as <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">section 4b of the majority opinion reads</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax. The payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penalties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation. Cf. <em>Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co</em>., 259 U. S. 20, 36â€“37. None of this is to say that payment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance. But the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS. And Congress’s choice of language — stating that individuals “shall” obtain insurance or pay a “penalty” — does not require reading §5000A as punishing unlawful conduct. It may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insurance. See <em>New York v. United States</em>, 505 U.S. 144, 169-174. Pp. 35-40.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes this perfectly reasonable argument so surprising is the fact that it is Chief Justice John Roberts’s vote securing its status as the majority opinion. In other words, we are shocked that the same <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/21/120521fa_fact_toobin">mastermind behind the takedown of campaign finance law</a> would suddenly show such deference to the legislative branch.</p>

<p>Roberts is taking a lot of flak for his position in the majority from both sides of the aisle. The focus of criticism from the left had less to do with the Affordable Care Act itself and more with long-term implications of the narrow interpretation of the Commerce Clause, as <a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.4/pamela_s_karlan_supreme_court_obamacare_ruling.php">summarized by Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has no effect in this particular case, because in this case the chief justice peeled away from that to sustain the act on taxing-power grounds. But it suggests that there are five justices who really do want to impose some limits on the commerce power, and, in a separate dissent, Justice Thomas repeated his belief that we should go back to the nineteenth-century version of commerce.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the left may be worried about the future, the right is bitter about the present, a bitterness that is directed straight at the Chief Justice. In an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303561504577496603068605864.html">editorial</a> in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Roberts is labeled with the biggest insult of all to those who fancy the Court a bastion of above-the-fray cognition and sagacity: politician.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chief Justice Roberts has created a creature that is not a tax for political purposes but is a tax for constitutional purposes. […] His ruling, with its multiple contradictions and inconsistencies, reads as if it were written by someone affronted by the government’s core constitutional claims but who wanted to uphold the law anyway to avoid political blowback and thus found a pretext for doing so in the taxing power.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this understanding is correct, then Chief Justice Roberts behaved like a politician, which is more corrosive to the rule of law and the Court’s legitimacy than any abuse it would have taken from a ruling that President Obama disliked. The irony is that the Chief Justice’s cheering section is praising his political skills, not his reasoning. Judges are not supposed to invent political compromises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea that the Court isn’t mired in politics or compromise seems kind of silly to me—this idealization of judicial purity is the conservative pipe dream that corresponds perfectly to the left’s belief that social change can (and should!) be initiated by a noble-minded judiciary. If the left errs in its naivety that men will be grateful for government’s interference in the name of justice and/or betterment, the right errs in its conviction that the naked principles of liberty are enough to solve our problems.</p>

<p>While my eyes are increasingly open to the pitfalls of government-led solutions to economic and social woes, at least the left is attempting to grapple with the problem of health care availability. Reading the above editorial, one gets the sense that the authors have no sympathy with people who are unable to get health insurance—indeed, it rather seems that they are so consumed by issues of constitutional purity that the existence of such a problem entirely fails to register. In short, liberty is grand, but the best kind of liberty is the freedom <em>to</em> do something about our difficulties, rather than permission to sit on our hands on the bench of the status quo.</p>

<h3 id="lets-call-the-whole-thing-off">Let’s call the whole thing off</h3>
<p>The presidential candidacy of Romney is surely the canary-in-the-mine of our dangerous obsession with principles (and power) rather than practicalities. We already know the story of how a man who claimed to be more liberal than Ted Kennedy on gay rights and who, as governor of Massachusetts, signed health care reform that provided near-universal coverage via the provision of an individual mandate now claims to “severely conservative.” We are either indifferent or cynical enough to recognize that these changes are to be expected in a system where there are only two options for seeking the highest office in the land: talk like a Democrat or talk like a Republican. Since the Democrat position was already occupied by the incumbent, Romney had no choice but to go to the right—and just how far right he had to go was not up to him, either, but was determined by the other candidates in the by-now-forgotten primary campaign.</p>

<p>Knowing all that, I don’t think anyone counts on Romney to be a paragon of consistency. Indeed, it is as if the outbreak of flip-flop outrage against John Kerry way back in 2004 has inoculated the American public against calculatingly opinionated politicians. While Kerry’s changeability went against his credibility, there seems to be an unspoken agreement among the supporters of Mitt Romney that no matter how many times the slate is blanked and rewritten—or the <a href="http://www.etchasketchmittromney.com/">Etch-A-Sketch shaken and re-doodled upon</a>—Romney remains consistent where it counts, i.e., he is not Barack Obama.</p>

<p>This exceedingly low threshold for Romney’s political viability goes a long way to explaining the candidate’s most recent episode of foot-in-mouth disease in the wake of the Supreme Court decision on Obamacare. While his top aide Eric Fehrnstrom <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/us/politics/romney-says-health-care-mandate-is-a-tax.html">said on July 2</a> that Romney did not believe the penalty (for not complying with the mandate to purchase health insurance) was a tax, by July 4, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7413844n">Romney felt the need</a> to state publicly that he accepted the ruling of the Supreme Court, and that, because the Supreme Court said so, the penalty must indeed be a tax.</p>

<p>This really got on some conservative nerves. The Supreme Court decision was bad enough, but Mitt Romney’s reaction to it was adding injury to insult. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> excoriated Romney for not jumping on the “it’s a tax” bandwagon and using it to accuse Obama of the ultimate swing-voter sin: raising taxes on the middle class. (Never mind, of course, that this group might include the very folks who would appreciate being able to purchase health insurance.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Romney should use the Supreme Court opinion as an opening to say that now that the mandate is defined as a tax for the purposes of the law, he will work to repeal it. <em>[…] </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Democrats would point to the Massachusetts record, but Mr. Romney could reply that was before the Supreme Court had spoken, that he had promised Bay Staters not to raise taxes, and so now the right policy is to repeal the tax along with the rest of ObamaCare. The tragedy is that for the sake of not abandoning his faulty health-care legacy in Massachusetts, Mr. Romney is jeopardizing his chance at becoming President.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps Mr. Romney is slowly figuring this out, because in a July 4 interview he stated himself that the penalty now is a “tax” after all. But he offered no elaboration, and so the campaign looks confused in addition to being politically dumb.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are harsh words for the only man standing between them and four more years of Obama. But as dumb as Romney may look, the advice the editorial is doling out seems even dumber. Romney, who was up until the decision itself, convinced that the mandate was unconstitutional, is now supposed to a) embrace the constitutionality of the mandate but then b) conclude that because it is constitutional <em>as a tax</em>, it is therefore bad policy—because, of course, the primary definition of a conservative is to be against taxes.</p>

<p>Even if Romney hadn’t been <em>for</em> the mandate when a) he was governor; b) the mandate was that of a state; and c) he called it a penalty, this reversal would be tricky—and largely unnecessary. I mean, if four of the Supreme Court Justices don’t think the mandate can be constitutionally construed as a tax, why is it so important that Romney express his willingness to go along with the majority opinion? Why couldn’t he say something like: “I am more convinced by the arguments of the dissenting opinions, but given that Congress could repeal the law, it is of little consequence that it has been allowed to stand on the constitutional grounds that it is a tax.”</p>

<p>But of course the reason Romney—or anyone else on the right—hasn’t done this is because it is (and remains) much easier to grandstand against the law on trumped-up violations of principles than objections to its policies. While the battle to paint Obamacare as a terrifying expansion of government’s powers of compulsion has been lost, the troops are falling back on the familiar anti-tax ramparts. But the cry is the same: the Affordable Care Act is a bad law, and it’s very unpopular. But as people who like the idea that Obama indeed does care about the issue of health insurance are quick to chime in, when asked about the things that the law would do—abolish rules regarding pre-existing conditions, set up exchanges to make it easier and cheaper to by insurance, abolish lifetime caps on coverage—people are overwhelming in favor of those policies.</p>

<p>Romney should have taken the opportunity to review the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/us/a-clearer-facsimile-of-the-declaration-of-independence.html">Declaration of Independence</a> this July 4—while it is imbued with a recognizably American ideological cockiness that has marked our Union since the beginning, it is also a list of very specific policy grievances that are about how people live, not just the principles (invoked imperfectly, as we well know) that should guide the redress of those wrongs. To the extent that the supporters of Obamacare want to get something done—or at least try—it is they who are the inheritors of the mantle of freedom and liberty so eloquently and daringly penned 236 years ago this week.</p>

<p>Ted Kaczynski made bombs. He has done many other things, but it is making bombs that has made him infamous. Indeed, were it not for the concession by the FBI allowing the so-called “Unabomber Manifesto” to be published, he might have eluded the authorities for even longer than 17 years. As it happened, his brother David recognized Ted as the author of “Industrial Society and its Future” when it was published in the Washington Post in mid-September 1995, and Kaczynski was arrested in early April the following year.</p>

<p>He was arrested where he had lived since 1971, in his small wooden home in rural Montana. Kaczynski had never been fond of modern ways of living, and had already planned on living in the wilderness when he accepted a job at UC Berkeley to teach math in 1967. He taught for two years to save up some money, and then headed off to opt out of a lifestyle he found not only devoid of personal satisfaction, but also a terrible threat to both human dignity and the planet’s well-being.</p>

<p>As remarked by David Skrbina—a professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan-Dearborn who has maintained a long-term correspondence with Kaczynski since his imprisonment—we might never have heard from Ted Kaczynski again. But the tranquility he had found was imperfect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In one of his letters to me, he recounts how both recreationists and the Forest Service continually pressed in on him—to the point where a peaceful life was no longer possible. This invasion constituted a kind of war, and Kaczynski began to defend himself. (Introduction, Technological Slavery, 2010)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is pointless to defend Kaczynski’s actions as reasonable within our society’s expectations, which takes as a given that violence is not an appropriate response to being inconvenienced, whether this takes the form of being cut off in traffic or being pestered by the Forest Service. But to dismiss Kaczynski as ill or illogical simply because he chose to commit violent acts is misguided. Not only are Kaczynski’s arguments rational and lucidly expressed, they are also increasingly relevant to our contemporary predicament. As Skrbina points out, Kaczynski is not alone in raising the alarm about the perils of our increasingly reliance on—<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html">and possible elimination by</a>—the advance of technology.</p>

<p>Personally, I find Kaczynski’s writings incredibly interesting, even fascinating. I suspect he is right that there are no fixes to the technological system that can remedy the problems it has created. I am a pessimist in this regard—I think we will probably keep on going like this until something truly terrible happens. As the saying goes, no one changes until the pain of changing is less than the pain of staying the same.</p>

<p>My mother finds it difficult to understand why I am willing to credit Kaczynski’s ideas. Perhaps she believes that credible insight into life can only come from someone who shares one’s values. This is an understandable position, but it has never  been my own. Indeed, our society seems content to take—or to claim to take—its main principles from a book written in a time and place with a values system so radically different from our own that it strains credulity. Yes, I mean the Bible.</p>

<p>That said, certainly I do not advocate making bombs. I don’t even have a desire to go live off the grid, let alone any passion for a revolutionary movement to provoke the demise of the technological system. (Heck, I read <em>Technological Slavery</em> on my Kindle, and now I’m blogging about it.) But I nonetheless relate to Kaczynski’s theories regarding the human need for autonomy, for meaningful work, and for a daily closeness to the natural world. He continues in that interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[O]ne learns that boredom is a disease of civilization. […] Boredom is almost nonexistent once you’ve become adapted to life in the woods. If you don’t have any work that needs to be done, you can sit for hours at a time just doing nothing, just listening to the birds or the wind or the silence, watching the shadows move as the sun travels, or simply looking at familiar objects. And you don’t get bored. You’re just at peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I enjoy my morning listening only to the birds, or take time in the afternoon to stare at the backyard, or let the sound of rain on the roof put me to sleep, I, too, feel that peace, the peace of just being, merely observing and absorbing the pleasantness of one’s surroundings. Should we not be moved by these words because the Unabomber wrote them? I say we should still be moved. Indeed, the fact that Kaczynski’s tranquil withdrawal gave way to acts of terrorist provocation makes his insight into the possibilities of a peaceful existence all the more poignant.</p>

<h3 id="the-nature-of-things">The nature of things</h3>
<p>Stephen Greenblatt is an academic, but his latest book, <em>The Swerve: How the World Became Modern</em>, is a foray into the genre of popular non-fiction. And it is a pure delight. The book relates the fortunes of one ancient text, the Latin poet Lucretius’s <em>De rerum natura</em>, and the adventures of one Renaissance man, the Italian book-hunter Poggio Bracciolini.  who rediscovered Lucretius’s poem in a monastery library and launched its subversive, Epicurean ideas into fifteenth-century Europe, and so into the modern world.</p>

<p>While I happen to have, like the author, a personal connection to Lucretius’s poem, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rerum_natura">On the Nature of Things</a> is not a well-known text outside the ranks of classical scholarship. Written in the first century B.C.E, the book-length verse-form composition describes Epicurean philosophy to a Roman audience, and includes ideas about physics, astronomy, biology, and anthropology.</p>

<p>First among the tenets of Epicureanism is the principle of atomism, which holds that all that exists is a combination of irreducibly tiny particles in various combinations, interacting within the void. While this materialist emphasis means that the soul is not immortal, the determinism such materialism implies is not absolute—the random “swerve” of atoms accounts for chance events and forms the basis of free will.</p>

<p>The notion of the “swerve” alleviates what Epicurus considered the main source of misery in human life—fear of the wrath or caprice of the gods. Once one understands that the universe operates according to principles of physics rather than according to the wiles of all-powerful deities, one is free from such dread, whether in this life or after death. While Lucretius did not deny the existence of the Roman deities, he maintained that they had no involvement in human affairs. Accordingly, the proper attitude toward human life—so counseled Epicurus—was therefore not one of fear and worry, but one of enjoyment and contentment.</p>

<p>I have purposely avoided the use of the term pleasure in the above description of Epicurean philosophy, despite the fact that it is undoubtedly the most common principle generally associated therewith. One of the most fascinating parts of <em>The Swerve</em> is Greenblatt’s explanation of how Epicurean ideas about contentment in mortal existence were perceived as a scandalous threat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A philosophical claim that life’s ultimate goal is pleasure—even if that pleasure was defined in the most restrained and responsible terms—was a scandal, both for pagans and for their adversaries, the Jews and later the Christians. Pleasure as the highest good? What about worshipping the gods and ancestors? Serving the family, the city, and the state? Scrupulously observing the laws and commandments? Pursuing virtue or a vision of the divine? These competing claims inevitably entailed forms of ascetic self-denial, self-sacrifice, even self-loathing. None was compatible with the pursuit of pleasure as the highest good. (78)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the following chapter, Greenblatt describes how, once Christianity had established itself as the state religion, it went about discrediting and then eliminating Epicurean philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What had to be undertaken was was the difficult project of making what appeared simply sane and natural—the ordinary impulses of all sentient creatures—seem like the enemy of the truth. […] Early Christians, brooding on the sufferings of the Savoir, the sinfulness of mankind, and the anger of a just Father, found the attempt to cultivate pleasure manifestly absurd and dangerous. […] The most ardent early believers in this doctrine… were determined to make the pain to which all humankind was condemned their active choice. (102, 104-105)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Greenblatt then provides a fascinating account of routine corporeal punishments in early monasteries and convents, and finally the incorporation of self-inflicted pain into mainstream Church practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The insistance that punishment be actively embraced by the victims—literalized in the kissing of the rod—marked a deliberate Christian trampling on the Epicurean credo of pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain. After all, the experience of pain was not only punishment; it was a form of pious emulation. Christian hermits, brooding on the sufferings of the Savior, mortified their flesh, in order to experience in their own bodies the torments that Jesus had to undergo. Though these acts of self-scourging began to be reported in late antiquity… it was not until the eleventh century that a monastic reformer, the Italian Benedictine Peter Damian, established voluntary self-flagellation as a central ascetic practice acceptable to the Church. It had taken a thousand years to win the struggle and secure the triumph of pain seeking. (106-107)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As what was once a “radical counterculture” (108) spread into the mainstream, a defense of pleasure became impossible. It wasn’t, of course, that pleasure-seeking activity ceased; it was simply that it became “philosophically indefensible,” such that “virtually no one in moral authority, no one with a public voice, dared speak up to justify any of it” (109). To be Christian was to insist—regardless of what one actually did—on the goodness of abnegation. “Epicurus was dead and buried, almost all of his works destroyed. And after St. Jerome in the fourth century briefly noted that Lucretius had committed suicide, there were no attacks on Epicurus’s great Roman disciple. He was forgotten” (109).</p>

<p>Epicurus may no longer be technically forgotten, but we seem nonetheless equally timid, even naive, when it comes to our attempts at formulating a non-threatening role for self-regulation based on the principle of the avoidance of pain. Two columnists in the <em>New York Times</em> have recently considered the relationship between pleasure and morality. Last week, Maureen O’Dowd asked <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/opinion/dowd-is-pleasure-a-sin.html">Is Pleasure A Sin?</a>, a question that makes sense only under the long shadow of the Catholic Church, which has, as we know, treated it as such for the last 2000 years.  Feminist liberal that she is, O’Dowd pulls out the traditional rants against Vatican: it is out of touch, backward-looking, and bent on the subjugation of women. On that final point, O’Dowd gripes about the Vatican’s recent censure of the 2006 book <em>Just Love: a Framework for Christian Sexual Ethics</em>, authored by Sister Margaret Farley, a professor emeritus at Yale’s Divinity School and, as her title implies, a nun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This latest ignoble fight with a noble nun adds to the picture of a Catholic Church in a permanent defensive crouch, steeped in Borgia-like corruption and sexual scandals, lashing out at anyone who notes the obvious: They have lost track of right and wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Lost</em> track? But the Church never gave any ground when it came to endorsing pleasure! O’Dowd falls, unthinkingly it seems, into the erroneous notion that it is modernity that has given people the courage to conceive as pleasure as other than sin, when this is simply not so. Similarly, she seems to think it is modern social expectations, such as those regarding the status of women, that make the Vatican’s dogma seem retrograde. But this, too, is untrue. While it might appear that the Church plays favorites with its dogmatic demands, this is only because the original flavor of its equal-opportunity pain-seeking philosophy has been diluted over time. In short, we have less self-flagellation and more discussion of contraception. But the so-called “war on women” is at bottom simply more of the same old thing the Church threw against men, women, and children alike from the earliest times: Christ versus Epicurus, pain versus pleasure, morality versus sin.</p>

<p>David Brooks, in his column <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/opinion/brooks-the-moral-diet.html">The Moral Diet</a> comes straight out and observes that, thanks to the dominance of the Christian world view, “[f]or the past several centuries, most Westerners would have identified themselves fundamentally as Depraved Sinners. In this construct, sin is something you fight like a recurring cancer — part of a daily battle against evil.” Now, he argues, people are more likely to operate under the “Good Person Construct,” meaning we gauge our conduct according to an overall standard that, while drawing a firm line against clearly egregious acts, allows for the commission of peccadilloes with no loss of self-esteem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this construct moral life is more like dieting: I give myself permission to have a few cookies because I had salads for lunch and dinner. I give myself permission to cheat a little because, when I look at my overall life, I see that I’m still a good person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brooks, character-focused conservative that he is, advises us to “shoot for rectitude” rather than goodness, as the latter is “too vague and forgiving.” Too relative, he means: it is too easy to think that what you think is good <em>is</em> actually good. “We’re mostly unqualified to judge our own moral performances, so attach yourself to some exterior or social standards.” But even with that caveat, Brooks ends the column wondering if this strategy is not in fact “settling for mediocrity.”</p>

<p>Again, this is nothing less than a rehash of the old line that associates autonomy and pleasure-seeking with sin—as if the only choices we have are between self-flagellation (as Depraved Sinners) and anarchy (as Epicureans). “Next time you feel tempted by something, recite the Ten Commandments,” one paragraph begins. Really? Am I reading this in 2012, in of all places the <em>New York Times</em>? Is this the state of our public discourse about morality? I hardly know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>It is thanks to Ray Bradbury that I understand this world I grew into for what it is: a dystopian future. And it is thanks to him that we know how to conduct ourselves in such a world: arm yourself with books. Assassinate your television. Go for walks, and talk with your neighbors. Cherish beauty; defend it with your life. Become a Martian. —Tim Kreider, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/opinion/uncle-rays-dystopia.html">Uncle Ray’s Dystopia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This week also marked the passing of Ray Bradbury, the celebrated writer of popular science fiction. The outpouring of remembrance of his life and literary contributions again reminds us that we rather enjoy dystopic imaginations of our future world. Indeed, one need look no further than the recent <em>Hunger Games</em> phenomenon.</p>

<p>Bradbury was a sort of Luddite—he never learned to drive, and for a long time he didn’t fly. Yet it seems he eschewed technology not out of a deep-seated hostility, but rather for reasons of both indifference and of aesthetic preference. On the first count, he was confident that his pen and paper could <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.10/bradbury.html">out-create a computer</a>, and on the second, he simply didn’t like things that were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/opinion/uncle-rays-dystopia.html?_r=1">ugly, loud, or vulgar</a>. Perhaps he could be described as a sort of minimalist, someone devoted to the aesthetics of unnecessary improvements, from airplanes to higher ed. Indeed, he credited the library for giving him a career as a writer that [no college degree could have](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/books/ray-bradbury-popularizer-of-science-fiction-dies-at-91.html?pagewanted=1”.</p>

<p>His suspicions regarding technology, and the miserable world he predicted it would lead to, seem to have captured his imagination without depleting a sense of hope. Bradbury’s visions were dsytopic, but his tendencies were anything but nihilist and reclusive; he kept writing till the end, and he granted numerous interviews and appearances. It was as if he managed to somehow contain his foreboding within his art and simultaneously manage a regular existence of work, marriage, and family.</p>

<p>It is likely for this reason that we remember Bradbury with fondness; though his ideas are dark, even radical, his delivery of them was not just palatable but engrossing, delightful. Yet as Kreider reminds us, we shouldn’t let the amusing, sentimental Bradbury distract us from the dire, exhortatory one, the man who was issuing nothing less than a call to arms. That these arms are books not bombs, and that the victims are televisions not technophiles—this should not obscure the importance of the necessary struggle for autonomy, dignity, and, most important of all, tranquility.</p>

<p>Maher is not wrong in his identification of religious belief as an obstacle toward consensus around many urgent environmental issues. If you treat the Bible as a source of scientific information, then you aren’t going to be impressed by the ‘evidence’ of scientific cosmology. If you believe that the world is destined to be destroyed, well, you aren’t likely to be too concerned by the secular predictions of doomsday in the form of environmental catastrophes. But it would be reductive to claim that everyone who rejects the science on climate change does so out of religious faith; to do so would be to confuse the specific freedom of religion with a broader right to skepticism about anything, for no reason other than one’s personal feeling. As the all-too-honest quote of Renee Domico illustrates, her objection to the teaching of climate change is rooted in much more visceral place than the defense of the Bible: she simply just doesn’t want to hear that her family and her lifestyle are destructive. And frankly, who would?</p>

<p>Pier Paolo Pasolini, best known for his films, but also an accomplished novelist, poet, playwright, and essayist, understood the Catch-22 of good things (such as having children) colliding with circumstances that rendered them no longer unequivocally good. In writing in regard to the referendum to legalize of abortion in Italy in 1975, Pasolini emphasized that the proper context for the question was wider than political ideology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The context in which abortion should be considered is an ecological one: it is the demographic tragedy, that, on an ecological horizon, presents itself as the most serious threat to the survival of humanity. <em>[…]</em> In the past, the couple was blessed, today it is cursed. <em>[…]</em> And so also with weddings: at one time they were celebrations… Now instead they all seem like grey and hurried funeral rites. The reason for these terrible things I am saying is clear: at one time the “species” had to fight to survive, therefore births “had to” be greater than deaths. Today on the contrary the “species,” if it wants to survive, must find a way that births are not greater than deaths. Thus, at one time, each baby that was born, being a guarantee of life, was blessed: each baby that is born today, on the contrary, is a contribution to the self-destruction of humanity, and is thus cursed. We are thus arrived at the paradox that what was once said to be against nature is natural, and that what was once said to be natural is against nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pasolini’s specific point about the alterable relationship between ‘nature’ and the ‘natural’ is the now-precarious denigration of homosexual sex, which has been condemned as ‘unnatural’ precisely because of its ‘non-reproductive’ nature. In today’s context of marriage equality, where gays and lesbians are (or will be, eventually) granted the same right to marry on the basis that the nature and possible goals of their unions are no different from those of different-sex couples, Pasolini’s argument about the beneficial status of homosexual (non-procreative) sex seems fairly arcane. Yet Pasolini’s concept of wrongful birth is still alive and well, albeit not in the ecological context of reproductivity, but within the related domain of ‘productivity’.</p>

  <p>It’s a pro-life bill on every account, yes. It sends the message that all life is worth protecting, is worth living, whether you are born with a disability or not. —Nancy Barto, Arizona State Senator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/15/152687638/should-parents-be-able-to-sue-for-wrongful-birth">wrongful birth made the news</a>, as several state legislatures debate laws that would prevent couples from suing a doctor who fails to warn them about fetal problems.</p>

<p>The legal concepts of wrongful birth and wrongful life <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/12/style/courts-weigh-value-of-unwanted-lives.html">are not new</a>. Wrongful birth suits are brought by parents when a child—often disabled but sometimes healthy—is born as the result of medical negligence, such as a failed vasectomy or tubal ligation, whereas wrongful life suits are brought on behalf of a disabled child, whose life, it is argued, is wrongful and would not exist were it not for medical negligence. Accordingly, the damages for wrongful birth are based on the parents’ lifespans, while in wrongful life they are assessed in terms of the child’s life expectancy.</p>

<p>The overlap of this issue with the pro-life cause is obvious, as such lawsuits assert after birth what is often asserted before birth through the choice to terminate a pregnancy: preference that the child not have been born.</p>

<p>The link between this preference and ‘disabilities’ is an especially sensitive topic. The issue is further clouded by the grouping together of a child born with a severe defect (say, spina bifida) or terminal disease (say, Tay-Sachs) and a child born with a disability that does not threaten the fact of her life but rather the much more subjective issue of its quality.</p>

<p>While a lawsuit in which parents declare that they would have preferred that their child not have been born cannot help but seem in some respect repugnant, the idea that there is something immoral about regret is wrongheaded. There is no moral imperative that someone be happy about the cards she is dealt by fortune, and if parents choose to rail against misfortune in the form of a lawsuit, that is hardly a moral failing. Nor does minimizing the hardships entailed by the birth of a disabled child constitute a claim to a moral high ground.</p>

<p>It seems that the better our technology is at seeing into the womb, the more we look through a glass darkly. Faith, be it in the great powers of medicine or in the mysterious ways of God, is not a guarantee of outcomes, but merely a safe harbor for our spirits, buffeted by the seas of ever-uncertain circumstances. When one could know nothing of a child’s health before she entered the world, there could be no standoff between the hang-wringing of denial (“This shouldn’t happen!) and the applause of endorsement (“This should happen!”). Life, in all its vagaries, simply came, and was received with the deference appropriately accorded to the inevitable.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Of all the benefits of modern medicine, none seems so comforting as those that promote and protect the health of newborns, and the mothers who bear them. (Although <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/magazine/ina-may-gaskin-and-the-battle-for-at-home-births.html">the role of hospital birth</a> in this project continues to be debated.) Surely the death of a child, though all too common throughout history, goes against our sense of the natural order of things, by which parents raise children, who grow into adults and in turn nurse their parents in old age.</p>

<p>Again, then, we are confronted with the conflict between nature and our sense of the natural, a conflict that no advances in medicine, pre- or post-natal, will ever resolve. To dwell with humility in this chasm between what we would wish and what is, neither unduly eschewing nor enshrining it: that is the ultimate grace.</p>

<p>This is the grace described by Emily Rapp, who, despite several pre-natal tests, nevertheless bore a son with Tay-Sachs. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/opinion/sunday/notes-from-a-dragon-mom.html">an opinion piece for the New York Times</a>, she describes the terribly unique experience of parenting a terminally ill child.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ronan won’t prosper or succeed in the way we have come to understand this term in our culture; he will never walk or say “Mama,” and I will never be a tiger mom. The mothers and fathers of terminally ill children are something else entirely. Our goals are simple and terrible: to help our children live with minimal discomfort and maximum dignity. We will not launch our children into a bright and promising future, but see them into early graves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rapp is also the author of a memoir in which she describes her struggles due to a congenital condition which left her, from childhood, reliant on a prosthetic leg. She makes no mention of her own disability in the piece about her son, which is only appropriate, for it has no bearing thereon.</p>

<p>The distance between these two texts, and the two experiences they describe, is not just that of time. In her memoir, Rapp describes a struggle to love herself, one that in her experience is fundamentally linked to her disability, but is entirely recognizable to others who have faced that same challenge, even without additional physical obstacles. In contrast, Rapp’s meditation on her son’s sad fate is a story of a different struggle, that to love freely under the constraints of tragic circumstances. The former is a story of evolution and overcoming; the latter a tale of devolution and acquiescence.</p>

<p>Both, however, came out of the same hope, and must therefore be honored. This call to honor is not a plea to our moral nature, but rather to that of our wondrous one. For it is wonder that is the only sure antidote to the condition of uncertainty that governs our mortal existence.</p>

You wouldn’t know it now, what with today’s crime shows obsessed with psychopaths, gruesome graphics, and fanciful only-on-TV technology, if not all three, but once upon a time people on TV murdered people they knew for the classic, banal reasons people have always murdered: anger, jealousy, greed. Murder was personal, not technological, and the people who solved these crimes were set apart not by their knowledge of bugs or ballistics but by their moral rectitude, by which I mean our total confidence that they would never be swayed by those base motives to commit such crimes.</p>

<p>One part of this moral exemplarity is their firm grounding in heteronormativity. Take Jessica Fletcher, heroine of “Murder, She Wrote”; she is a widowed school teacher whose sexual/romantic life is for all intents and purposes behind her. Indeed, in a way, the entire series hinges in a way on her remaining chaste, for in the show’s pilot, her would-be suitor turns out to be the murderer! With Jessica confirmed as the sexless schoolmarm,  the show can procede to take her safely into the messy marriages and busted businesses that motivate each week’s murder. Somewhat similarly, the incorruptibility of Lieutenant Columbo is guaranteed by his family-man status. However, in the case of this unique show, where we know from the beginning the identity of the culprit, the contrast between the murderous and the moral is reinforced by the invisibility of Mrs. Columbo, who is often discussed by never appears in the series.</p>

<p>The Myth of Miraculous Heterosexuality as propagated in “Macmillan &amp; Wife” is another element of this television-murder-morality connection. In this case, though, visibility is key: Mac and Sally have this beautiful relationship that is meant to represent The Normative, and it is this norm that is threatened by crime. Indeed, it is shocking how many episodes revolve around Sally’s endangerment, including the nearly tragic “The Fine Art of Staying Alive” (season 2, episode 6) in which she is kidnapped and held for the ransom of a famous painting. Mac, despondent and almost hapless, is prompted to recall the day he proposed to Sally as he contemplates the horror of her possible murder.</p>

<p>This episode makes clear that greed—which I daresay remains a far more popular off-screen motive for murder than psychopathy!— threatens the life of personal bliss and public service that Mac and Sally represent. This is the where we get to the heart of the MoMH: “Macmillan &amp; Wife” sells us the convenient truth that the relationship between two people (in this case, man and wife) functions as a guarantor of safety, a linchpin of social order against the threat of disorder.</p>

<h3 id="rock-of-ages">Rock of Ages</h3>
<p>Of course, this is just TV; while the small screen is unparalleled in its responsiveness to cultural trends, today’s anything-goes climate belies the medium’s historical conservative tendencies. In the case of “McMillan and Wife,” we have the incredible irony that the paragon of heterosexual marriage is embodied by Rock Hudson, a gay man who became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Hudson#AIDS_and_death">the first celebrity to die of AIDS</a> (an event that did much to increase the visibility of the disease and the humanity of its victims). While TV has now made <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/the-new-mainstream-28-of-tv-watching-spent-on-lgbt-inclusive-shows/">not just peace but prosperity</a> with LGBT characters, people keep turning out on election day to vote against gay rights.</p>

<p>Indeed, as the recent passage in North Carolina of a constitutional amendment banning not just gay marriage but also civil unions sadly illustrates, a certain number of people are convinced by the Myth of Miraculous Heterosexuality’s notion that society at large rises or falls by the state’s enshrinement of contractual, monogamous, <em>heterosexual</em> relationships. While strictly speaking, legalizing gay marriage has nothing to do with the legality of gay sex, I find it hard to understand the resistance to gay marriage as being motivated purely by a reluctance to extend what amounts to a convenient legal contract (which is what marriage is, from the state perspective) to people of the same gender. I therefore suspect that it indeed has to do with sex; on this level, the state’s recognition of contractual, monogamous, <em>homosexual</em> relationships constitutes a declaration that there exists no appreciable difference, <em>as far as the state is concerned</em>, between sex between a man and a woman and that between two women or two men. And if one understands the state as representative of <em>society,</em> the situation becomes uncomfortable for those who want to rely on society to reinforce what they are teaching their children, namely that heterosexuality is okay but homosexuality less so.</p>

<p>In this sense, the resistance to gay marriage has much less to do with homosexism or homophobia than it does with a much more basic human dread, namely, that of being the last person caught holding an outdated opinion. While of course there will always be people who thrive on prejudice and bigotry, most people are very susceptible to the herd mentality (for better or for worse) and are more than prepared to go along (sooner or later) with the mainstream. This is the process through which societies and their mores and practices evolve over time, and while with the benefit of hindsight it looks natural, even inevitable, on an individual level, it can be quite painful for people to be prompted out of their comfort zones. This need for comfort is one reason why people teach their children to think according to their own prejudices, so they can have another voice reaffirming their own mindset.</p>

<p>If you’ve grown up hearing and then thinking that gay people are different, and gay relationships aren’t like straight relationships, well, it’s not going to feel good when you start hearing that to think that way means you are a bigot. And that charge makes people feel ashamed of what they have felt and (perhaps) have done. But instead of changing their minds (which requires facing the shame), many people defend themselves from that shame by digging in: they resolve that what they were told all along was right, and that therefore the charge of bigotry is heinously false. Or, in a variation on that theme, they whitewash the acting out of their prejudices. <a href="http://therumpus.net/2012/05/the-week-in-greed-6-to-behave-like-the-fallen-world/">Steve Almond’s analysis of Romney’s homophobic history</a> describes both its motivation by a quest for popularity as well as the candidate’s inability or refusal to feel remorse for his youthful misdeeds, because it is somehow more palatable to claim to have no memory of the event rather than to own up to have not only been homophobic (as many young boys were and are) but also physically cruel.</p>

<p>While I don’t mean to be breaking out the tiny violins for those against marriage equality in lieu of popping the champagne to celebrate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/us/politics/obama-says-same-sex-marriage-should-be-legal.html">Obama’s historic announcement in its favor</a>, I think it is important to point out that the reason that people in my generation (and younger) don’t “get” the problem people have with gay marriage is not just a question of our broader perspective. While certainly part of the changing attitudes toward homosexuality has to do with greater exposure to and greater comfort with gays and lesbians (the whole “family, friends, and neighbors” argument cited by Obama), prejudice can thrive even in the most intimate of circumstances—just look at the institution of slavery.</p>

<p>Not being prejudiced is partly about never learning to be so, but also never having an incentive to learn. If it is socially acceptable to be racist or homophobic—as it was not terribly long ago—many people will adopt those attitudes in order to reassure themselves that they, too, are socially acceptable, i.e., that they are the way the majority of people agree is the right way to be. The need to feel accepted is so strong that once the association between practice (in this case, disdaining or excluding others) and payoff (in this case, social acceptance) is formed, the practice sticks, having been internalized as principle, even when the payoff diminishes or disappears.</p>

<h3 id="legal-tender">Legal, tender</h3>
<p>The person who should be most keenly aware of this diminishing payoff is none other than Mitt Romney, who has been essentially forced to declare his opposition to gay marriage and civil unions in order to draw yet another line in the sand between the two major parties. For someone <a href="http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/quiet-rooms-like-the-quiet-car-on-the-acela/">who prefers a quiet room for discussions of income inequality</a>, you can only imagine the internal wincing Romney suffers when he must address such the issue he calls <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/us/politics/romney-reaffirms-opposition-to-marriage-or-similar-for-gay-couples.html">“a very tender and sensitive topic”</a>. While in his previous incarnation as a Massachusetts moderate, Romney once boasted to that state’s Log Cabin Republicans that he was more supportive of gay rights than Senator Edward M. Kennedy, now he is explicitly against granting gay couples equal marriage rights. Romney goes so far as to state that the issue isn’t one of semantics, i.e., the use of the term marriage; he’s against the granting of rights equivalent to marriage for same-sex couples under any name (civil union, domestic partnership), and he supports a constitutional amendment to this effect.</p>

<p>Even if we assume that Romney is indeed sincerely, personally opposed to marriage equality, he’s already demonstrated an ability to remake himself for the needs of his constituency. He should therefore be intelligent enough to understand that there is exceedingly little political capital to be gained from standing on the opposite side of history, even if that is what his constituency demands. Romney’s situation is the political equivalent of Chic-fil-A’s policy of remaining closed (out of religious conviction) on Sunday: no matter how diminished the returns become on that policy, they can’t change it without looking like hypocrites. There is simply no where to go but the status quo.</p>

<p>This is the note that the Obama campaign’s new “Forward” slogan seeks to hit—and Romney of all people has to understand, that in politics as in business, if you aren’t moving ahead, you are falling behind. Yet the party Romney has gone to contortionist lengths to woo is all about looking backwards, in both economic and social policy. Romney’s confidence that he can somehow stop the course of history and reinstate the military policy of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell is as misguided as his insistance that his straight-from-the-80s pro-military, anti-tax agenda is the ticket to revitalizing this country.</p>

<p>The idea that the country would bother to modify the constitution to deny equal recognition and appropriate legal conveniences to same-sex couples  is but the icing on this stale, backwards cake.</p>

<p>Let’s pop that champagne.</p>

<p>Today is the 100th anniversary of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>’s departure from Southampton, and the fascination with the grandeur of the ship and the grimness of the tragedy with which its name is now synonymous remain undiminished.</p>

<p>The <em>Titanic</em> disaster, although a century past, belongs in many ways to our modern age: the sinking of the unsinkable ship captures both the optimism of our technological hubris and the humility of our resignation to unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p>Today is also the day that Rick Santorum <a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2012/04/10/us/politics/100000001481150/rick-santorum-suspends-his-campaign.html">announced the suspension of his presidential campaign</a>. Considering that this moment was both inevitable and incredibly overdue, the timing of this announcement was better managed than much of the campaign that preceded it: his daughter Bella is out of the hospital, and the Pennsylvania primary is still a respectable fortnight away. He can put family first as well as avoid what would have been a needless exercise in humiliation—(another, if you count 2006) repudiation by his ‘home’ state voters. (The Santorums actually live in Virginia now.)</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/opinion/sunday/a-quantum-theory-of-mitt-romney.html">recent tongue-in-check opinion piece</a>, David Javerbaum profiles Mitt Romney as the first quantum politician—a politician whose qualities follow the beguiling rules of quantum physics, such as complementarity, uncertainty, and entanglement. While this seems like a too-interesting-by-half explanation for a too-uninspiring-by-far candidate (Romney’s been running for president <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_by_time_in_office">longer than a bunch of presidents have served in office</a>), it does indeed seem that we are at a point in this country where, to understand it, you must, to a new and unprecedented degree, be capable of entertaining contradictory ideas.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about routine differences of opinion on economic policies. Consider the question of unemployment insurance: you will find those who consider it an essential safety net, and those who believe that it provides an incentive for workers to remain unemployed. And, despite the struggles of millions of jobless Americans, we can more or less calmly have this discussion. (Anyone remember Occupy Wall Street? Didn’t think so.)</p>

<p>I’m talking about a different kind of debate. Rick Santorum wants all children conceived—regardless of the circumstances under which they were conceived, their parents’ willingness or ability to provide for them, or their medical prognosis—to be carried to term and lovingly provided for. He wears his heart on his sleeve for a daughter whose life he feels is more threatened by its diminishment by others than it is by her genetic disorder.</p>

<p>America is a place where both Santorum’s view <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/opinion/sunday/having-an-abortion-when-no-one-called-me-a-slut.html">and its opposite</a> feel logical, humane, and right. So it is safe to say that it is impossible to decide these questions as a nation. Actually, it is impossible even to <em>ask</em> them, given that entire nations don’t have babies—individuals do. These issues are rarely, if ever, settled satisfactorily by laws—a fact that, sadly, has rarely stopped legislatures from trying, then or now.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago, the world was stratified and unfair, and its highest and lowest sailed out together on the <em>Titanic</em> to meet their terrible, cold doom. The world is different now, surely, but it is still stratified and unfair, and, now as then, the poor get the worst of it when disaster strikes. And yet no one would propose legislating against shipwrecks.</p>

<p>And yet that, I say, is the legacy of the quixotic Santorum campaign, the candidate who would turn grief into legislation, his own private tragedy into public policy.</p>

<p>Tragedy, properly understood, is not something against which one crusades—or campaigns. It is the realization that you don’t get to make the world after your own ideas, no matter who you are and what you believe—even if, so many times, it seems as if you have done just that successfully.</p>

<p>The <em>Titanic</em> reminds us that no matter how big a ship you build, the ocean can take it and hide it and, eventually, dissolve it forever.</p>

<p>If you have no idea of the plot of this Barbara Stanwyck film from 1950, you’ll be pretty surprised to find out at the end of the opening scene that what is rotten in the state of suburban Illinois isn’t infidelity or loss of affection, but murder. The effect of that opening scene’s turn toward the noir is quasi comical; no sooner are we presented with the comfortable husband and wife, he with book, she with baby, in what appears to be a generic crisis of conjugal anomie than the voiceover takes us out of traditional melodrama and into film noir.</p>

<p>Murder, then, is at the heart of the film, and although I could very easily write an entire post about movie, instead I will take it as a jumping off point to compose a post I have been mulling over for a quite a while now about the evolution of murder shows on television.</p>

<p>Thanks to Netflix, it is now possible to relive many of our favorite shows minus the agony of advertising: nostalgia can perhaps be redefined as memory without commercial breaks. That comforting ritual that is the murder mystery, returns familiar but improved—the past is somehow brought back purer than ever in the midst of the relentless encroachment of advertising into every nook and cranny of our lives. Just this past week I’ve been listening to play-by-play baseball radio announcers seamlessly introduce ad copy into their calling of the game. Is nothing sacred?</p>

<h3 id="a-house-divided">A House Divided</h3>
<p>Among historic presidential houses, James Madison’s <a href="http://www.montpelier.org/">Montpelier</a> is somewhat of an outlier. While its nearby confederates Monticello and Mount Vernon both experienced periods of abandonment and disrepair before their respective renaissances, the 22-room house at Montpelier was built up into a 55-room, 12-bath mansion by the duPont family, following their purchase of the property in 1901.</p>

<p>Thus when it came time, over eight decades later, to restore the house to its presidential, pre-duPont state, the project was a kind of archeology excavation – the team literally had to dismantle the new structure piece by piece in search of Madison’s house under and within it. The result is simply unbelievable, and the metaphor is not inappropriate for Madison’s intense and thorough investigation of forms of government throughout history that he used to inform his drafting of the Virginia Plan. You can now sit in what was Madison’s library and watch an informative video while you imagine all of his books crowding around him as he formulated what would become the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>The Bill of Rights is a document that exemplifies the fundamental “shall not” nature that is at the heart of limited government, which was certainly a guiding principle for Madison.   A good federal government, as Madison understood it, was one that did as little as needed to accomplish its primary goal, which was the success of the Union. From that perspective, it is easy enough to understand the protections of the Bill of Rights as a continuation of the status quo, not an expansion of rights to new groups (e.g., slaves, the unpropertied, women).</p>

<p>The best thing that the federal government could do for Madison was stay out of his way. This is largely because Madison was at the top of the social and economic pyramid –  he was a propertied, slave-owning white male. But it is worth recalling that the world was also a different place. Madison spent his final years as an invalid, but he didn’t incur huge hospital bills. He didn’t fight with his insurance company. He was cared for – the way he was always cared for – by his household, including his slaves. It was a society based on labor arrangements that were as unjust as they were personal and enduring. Into this intimate world, into this world where power relationships were ultra-localized and irremediable, it would have been impossible to imagine the intervention of the federal government.</p>

<p>For Madison, then, any group that threatens to upset this local focus constitutions a faction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A faction can be a majority or a minority – Madison is under no illusion that the opinion that is most widely held should be therefore the rule of the day. Indeed, if nothing else, he views government as a tool to preserve the natural differences in the faculties of men and the varied relationships to property that result therefrom. Community in this sense has nothing to do with majority rule, and everything to do with non-interference in established power structures.</p>

<h3 id="majority-rules">Majority rules</h3>
<p>Society as Madison knew it would be entirely destroyed by the Civil War – the ultimate act of interference with the establishment – and supplanted by a nascent industrial society. It is this historical juncture to which we can trace the foundations of today’s domination-by-corporation. Out of the reluctant realization that slaves were people slowly emerged the compensatory hallucination that corporations were so, too. Indeed, as I’ve mentioned before, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, business interests sought relief on the grounds of the 14th Amendment far more frequently than did African Americans.</p>

<p>In this radically different contemporary context, any discussion of limited government must be of an entirely another sort than that which Madison was having with his learned tomes. To me, the desperate cry for the government to shrink down and slink away and leave us alone smacks of closing the barn door after the horse has bolted. After all, there is no longer anything limited about our personal entanglements with huge entities: huge corporations make everything from our phones to our prescription drugs, and other huge corporations pay our salaries, extend us credit, and ration our access to affordable medical care. Whatever you think of big government, its rise has largely paralleled the rise of big corp.</p>

<p>It is that symbiosis that gives rise to the peculiar current debate (legal and popular) over the Affordable Care Act. <a href="http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-rachel-maddow-show/46887349#46887424">Listen to Rachel Maddow</a>(skip to 3:35) explain how although crowds rant and rave about the evil Obamacare, when people are asked about the main elements of the law itself (rather than about ‘Obamacare’), folks of all political stripes overwhelming support them.</p>

<p>On the legal front, the respondents in <em>Dept. of Health and Human Services v. Florida</em> are maintaining that the free-market solution the law enacts to the health care crisis has at its heart an unconstitutional mandate to buy health insurance. While (as Justice Kennedy observed) it would be perfectly legal to construct a single-payer system, it is an entirely different matter for the government to insist that any consumer purchase something—even if hospitals are obligated to provide care regardless of a patient’s insurance status or ability to pay. The oddity—or, if you will concede to the colloquial usage of the term, this irony—that Congress crafted a law that favored a market-based solution (the same one proposed by conservatives at the time of Hillary Clinton’s attempts at healthcare reform) that is being attacked as unconstitutional did not go unremarked by Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/28/us/28scotus-transcript.html?ref=us">in his oral arguments on March 27</a> (p. 25).</p>

<p>From the standpoint of progressives who favor a single-payer system, Obamacare is actually a give-away to the insurance companies, for it enshrines their unsustainable model as federal law. A thoughtful friend of mine, who gave up his own blog years ago, summed up the situation thus: Obamacare is More Cowbell – it may expand coverage, but, because it falls short of radical change, it won’t do very much to address the root causes of escalating health care costs. While the government can set its reimbursement rates and thus restrain costs, the equivalent force in the market is open competition. So if you aren’t going to go the single-payer route, you’d be better off with increased competition rather than mandated participation. As we’ve proved with the deregulation of telephony and airfares, open competition tends to radically lower costs.</p>

<h3 id="minority-report">Minority report</h3>
<p>Shortly before the Supreme Court heard arguments in the <em>Dept. of Health v. Florida</em>, an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/us/new-look-at-an-old-memo-casts-more-doubt-on-rehnquist.html">article in the New York Times</a>reported on recent developments in a story from the Court’s past. In 1952, William H. Rehnquist <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST/pdf/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST-4-16-6.pdf">wrote a memo about the segregation cases</a> (including the iconic <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>) then pending before the Court. Rehnquist denied—both at his initial confirmation hearing in 1971 and again in 1986 when he was nominated for the position of Chief Justice—that this memo reflected his views, insisting that he wrote it in the voice of the judge for whom he was then clerking, Robert H. Jackson. As the Times reports, <a href="http://bclawreview.org/review/53_2/05_snyder_barrett/">new research</a> lends further support to the argument that the opinions in the memo were indeed Rehnquist’s own.</p>

<p>In this memo, Rehnquist argues that the high court cannot hope for any historical continuity if it intervenes on questions of treatment of minority groups by majorities. Citing the unusually quick reversal of opinion in the <a href="http://www.sunnylandsclassroom.org/Downloads/ACBooks/Pursuit%20of%20Justice/Chapters/85-92_Ch.10.pdf">Jehovah’s Witness flag salute cases</a>, in which the court overruled its 1940 decision in 1943, Rehnquist predicted that any court tempted to interfere in these such matters would find its rulings made irrelevant by the passage of time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One hundred and fifty years of attempts on the part of this Court to protect minority rights of any kind— whether those of business, slaveholders, or Jehovah’s Witnesses—have been sloughed off, and crept silently to rest. If the present Court is unable to profit by this example it must be prepared to see its work fade in time, too, as embodying only the sentiments of a transient majority of nine men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Rehnquist recognizes that it would be the compassionate thing to do to vote to overrule state-mandated segregation, he doesn’t believe that it is the proper role of the Court.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by “liberal” colleagyes <em>[sic]</em>, but I think <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> was right and should be re-affirmed. If the fourteenth Amendment did not enact Spencer’s Social Statios <em>[sic]</em>, it just as surely did not enact Myrddahl’s <em>[sic]</em> American Dilemna <em>[sic]</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What could be right about <em>Plessy</em>, the now infamous decision from 1896 that upheld Jim Crow? Here is a critical passage from <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/163/537/case.html">the <em>Plessy</em> decision</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff’s argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it. The argument necessarily assumes that if, as has been more than once the case and is not unlikely to be so again, the colored race should become the dominant power in the state legislature, and should enact a law in precisely similar terms, it would thereby relegate the white race to an inferior position. We imagine that the white race, at least, would not acquiesce in this assumption. The argument also assumes that social prejudices may be overcome by legislation, and that equal rights cannot be secured to the negro except by an enforced commingling of the two races. We cannot accept this proposition. If the two races are to meet upon terms of social equality, it must be the result of natural affinities, a mutual appreciation of each other’s merits, and a voluntary consent of individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However far-fetched, willful and racist this passage may read to modern eyes, it enshrines a principle of non-interference that Rehnquist holds dear in quixotic quest (nine <em>men</em>?) to mould the Court into more than a representative body of its time and place. The rightness of <em>Plessy</em> and the grounds on which separate but equal should be upheld, apparently has to do with a refusal to believe that the law can or should create social truths.</p>

<p>In this memo, Rehnquist refers to two books of social theory in his call to keep the Fourteenth Amendment clear of any such interpretations. The first, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Statics">Herbert Spencer’s 1851 tome Social Statics</a>, is a libertarian prequel to the author’s later work in which he would coin the phrase “survival of the fittest”. This is not a chance mention, but rather a reference to the Court’s own history, specifically Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.’s dissent in the landmark case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York"><em>Lochner v. New York</em></a>, a 1905 case in which the majority ruled that a New York labor law restricting the maximum work hours of bakers interfered with their liberty to contract. Holmes famously quipped that “the Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s <em>Social Statics</em>.” Rehnquist here is expanding on Holmes’ remark by referring to the 1944 study by Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal on U.S. race relations, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Dilemma">An American Dilemma</a>. His point is that just as the Fourteenth Amendment shouldn’t be co-opted by laissez-fair proponents in order to overturn state legislation, nor should it be, in his opinion, co-opted by “liberals” against segregation to overturn state-enshrined Jim Crow.</p>

<p>Whether one views the long aftermath of the <em>Brown</em> decision hopefully or cynically, it is nevertheless of great comfort that separate but equal is no longer the <em>law</em> of the land. Rehnquist may be right that no court can alter the hearts of men, but there can be no doubt that the legal principle of <em>stare decisis</em> is a foreign concept to the workings of history, which undulates forward as surely as the world turns. As the needless death of Trayvon Martin makes clear, race relations in this country are still fraught with tension, tension that can too easily escalate into deadly violence. (And yet notice how there is <em>no</em> mention of gun control in the aftermath… ah, Florida…) While the prejudices that sparked the suspicions of Zimmerman are unfortunately widespread, it wasn’t so long ago that the result of such an encounter would have been not the shot of one misguided housing development vigilante’s gun, but a mob lynching. (Not to mention the fact that a Hispanic man with a Jewish last name might have then proved an equally attractive target for the assaults of prejudice.) To Trayvon’s family and friends, this circumstance makes no difference, for a young man is dead. But to the community as a whole, and to history at large, it makes all the difference in the world.</p>

<h3 id="forest-from-the-trees">Forest from the trees</h3>

<p>Is there <a href="http://wamu.org/news/12/02/22/virginia_paper_company_linked_with_rainforest_destruction">a bit of the Indonesian forest in your bathroom</a>? There might be, if in fact the supplier Asian Pulp and Paper is using rainforest trees (some from land that they have set aside for a tiger sanctuary) as raw materials for its paper products—including that <em>indispensible</em> disposable rolled up next to your commode. This classic we-said-they-said environmental controversy (the company denies the WWF’s claim) got me thinking about the meaning of uncertainty, and the nature of imponderables past and present. Somehow, I see an important shift between wondering about the origins of the world and human life and contemplating whether my nether regions are contributing to deforestation.</p>

<p>The shift is not ultimately one of scale, or even one of received truth versus observed truth (à la religion vs. science). No, the shift is more subtle and has to do with what one might call harmonious authority. Harmonious authority exists where received knowledge takes the form of inspiration and instruction. It is authority conceived not as the suppression of logic or liberty, but as the source thereof. By harmonious I don’t mean happy or feel-good, but I do mean functioning in a generative capacity.</p>

<p>This notion describes rather well I think the instructions given by God via Moses in the Torah as to how the people of Israel are to set themselves apart so that He will dwell in their midst. Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy contain extensive lists of commandments and instructions. Famously, the Israelites complain during their time in the wilderness, longing for the certain comforts of life in Egypt, despite their status as slaves. (And in His wrath, God decides that everyone of that complaining generation will perish in the wilderness and never see the promised land.)</p>

<p>In short, the Old Testament makes clear that Israel isn’t ‘chosen’ because its people are better, but because God made a promise to its ancestors and intends to honor it — even if it means dwelling within a community that is, like all human communities, imperfect (sinful). While the direct presence of God in the formation of this community should not be overlooked, I suspect that the local orientation of God’s intervention is of equal importance. The days of the tabernacle emphasize the importance of this locality, as the tabernacle was designed to travel with Israel on its way to the land that God has designated for them. The material objects mandated for the tabernacle and its contents, and the fact that the Israelites are able to acquire and and construct them, lend a important local intimacy to Israel’s rigorous worship practices.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the environmentally-conscious consumer are of an entirely different order, and thus not easily inserted into this Biblical picture of locality and its harmonious authority. I cannot imagine what it would have been like to live in an ancient community where worship revolved around animal sacrifice — but I’m certain that it would seem equally strange to such a community to receive the articles of one’s daily life from the other side of the globe. The strangeness of each to the other is real. While I suspect that Rick Santorum was trying (and failing) to score cheap political points when he mouthed off rather senselessly about Obama’s “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/us/politics/santorum-criticizes-education-system-and-obama.html">phony theology</a>,” I think that many people feel a genuine discomfort with the nature of our modern problems, particularly those regarding the environment. The idea that you can contribute to the destruction of the rainforest with a thoughtless wipe of your you-know-what flies in the face of the admittedly comforting notion that our dominion over the natural world is part of God’s harmonious authority. Perhaps there exists an unconscious nostalgia for the reassurance provided by the local nature of God’s presence — in both his blessing and his wrath — that cannot be matched by the surveyors of the rainforest, despite the verifiable urgency of their concerns.</p>

<p>The real problem isn’t, I think, as Santorum put it, that the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/santorum-phony-theology-referred-to-obamas-world-view-not-his-religion/">“world view” of Obama et al. “elevates the earth above man,”</a> but rather the scary prospect that we may no longer be in a position to put ourselves first without leading to our own destruction. Faced with the disturbing possibility that banning abortions and gay marriage isn’t enough to ensure our continued prosperity as a nation (and species), it is surely a whole lot easier to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/opinion/republicans-against-science.html">deny global warming as the hoax</a> of those unreassuring secular types. And to <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/01/19/145465011/new-restrictions-on-abortion-almost-tied-record-last-year">keep passing laws restricting abortion</a> and <a href="http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/02/virginia-senate-votes-to-pass-gay-adoption-discrimination--72864.html">gay rights</a>. (Console yourself with Jon Stewart’s recent remarks on <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-february-21-2012/chris-christie-s-gay-marriage-bill-veto">Chris Christi’s same-sex marriage veto</a> and <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-february-21-2012/punanny-state---virginia-s-transvaginal-ultrasound-bill">Virginia’s mandatory ultrasound bill</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="burning-rage">Burning rage</h3>
<p>If the fact that we’ve occupied their country for a decade now weren’t cause an adequate cause for Afghan aggrievement, the US military has certainly done the trick by carelessly burning several copies of the Koran at a NATO base in Bagram, Afghanistan. The resulting outrage has already claimed the lives of nearly a dozen protesters around the country as well as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/world/asia/afghanistan-koran-burning-protests-enter-fifth-day.html">four American soldiers</a>: two were shot on Feb. 23 by a Afghan Army soldier at a base in the eastern part of the country, and two more who were shot execution style on Feb. 25, inside a supposedly secure area of the Interior Ministry in Kabul. (The suspect is an employee in one of the departments in the Interior Ministry.) If President Obama’s formal apology over the Koran burning was issued to prevent this kind of response, it does not seem to have helped. Martine Van Bijlert, a co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/world/asia/afghan-protests-over-koran-burning-break-out-in-kabul.html">quoted in the Times</a>, said that “the violence is almost within the normal realm of things that you would see after this kind of incident,” a statement one hardly knows whether to take with incredulity or profound disappointment.</p>

<p>While I can scarcely imagine the anger and frustration that results from over a decade of foreign occupation, and one can sympathize with the Afghan people who have been victimized as a result of the actions of others (the Saudi terrorists of 911, the Afghan Taliban who harbored Osama bin Laden), there is something disturbing about the idea that the action of burning the Koran – regardless of its circumstances – can reliably trigger such a response. Is it the general outrage at America or the values it represents so overwhelming as to short-circuit any circumstantial consideration? Granted, after ten years, American forces should know how to handle religious texts and items as to avoid adding insult to the injuries of occupation, but is it therefore impossible for anyone to rationalize that, given how poorly such an action serves the Americans’ own interests, that it must have indeed been a hideous oversight rather than a willful provocation?</p>

<p>Or is this distinction truly irrelevant? And if so, what does that mean about the nature of belief, and the function of outrage in relation to it? I don’t presume to have any answers to these big questions, but I think that this problematic is fundamental to the present historical moment. It is precisely the space between this rock and hard place that Rick Santorum found himself in the final (phew!) Republican debate last week when he was confronted about the divergence between his personal views about contraception and his public stance in regard to legislation. Specifically, he finds himself attacked by both Ron Paul and Mitt Romney for voting for the standard omnibus appropriations bill because it includes funding for Planned Parenthood. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoFfUg8YtC0&amp;t=52m44s</p>

<p>In the first part of this clip, you find Ron Paul making what seems like a very unlibertarian-like argument about defunding Planned Parenthood. Doctor that he is, he schools us on the fact that the so-called ‘morning after pill’ is identical to birth control, which means that you can’t restrict the former without restricting the latter. Somehow he gets from here to the notion that, if you give money to Planned Parenthood to buy birth control, they subsequently have more money “left over” with which to do abortions. Huh? The audience cheers at his call to defund Planned Parenthood entirely, presumably because of its pro-life sympathies. But when Rick Santorum tries to defend himself about voting for the bill that includes Title X by talking about Title XX, which establishes federal funding for abstinence programs, Paul finally shows his hand by also objecting to Title XX on the grounds that all these kinds of programs overstep the Constitutional mandate of the federal government.</p>

<p>Although that notion receives some applause from the crowd, Romney returns to the real task at hand, which is making Santorum look like a hypocrite for not voting against every single bill that involves a policy with which he doesn’t entirely agree. This is sophistry at its highest, but it works: there are audible boos as Santorum tries to parse out the definitive nature of his personal stance and the more pragmatic quality of his legislative record. While a reasonable person would point out that it is the height of ridiculousness to purport that the ideal politician is one who votes the way he <em>personally</em> feels about an issue, and that anyone who doesn’t do this in every case is a hypocrite or a horrid ‘flip-flopper’, this argument isn’t available to Santorum, because he himself subscribes to the politician-as-moral-crusader model. By that measure, he’s damned (haha) whatever he does, because if he’s coming for our birth control, the center calls him an extremist, and if he isn’t, the right calls him a liberal.</p>

<p>So much for the notion that an elected official is a representative of the will of the people! So much for the political realities of legislative Washington and the art of compromise! It makes one shake one’s head in disbelief, this thick-headedness. To think that fifty years ago people worried that JFK’s Catholicism would render him representative of the papacy and not an independent actor. Now the Republicans are slinging mud at Santorum for the exact opposite reason. And Santorum has no comeback; stranded as he is on the exposed cliff that is the moral high ground, he can only rant and rave ridiculously. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/rick-santorum-jfks-1960-speech-made-me-want-to-throw-up/">Watch him on ABC’s This Week</a> (skip to 12:59) as he discusses his reaction to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDP4qrA8hvg">Kennedy’s famous speech</a> about the separation between church and state with repeated references to vomiting. Yes, you read that right – it makes Santorum want to throw up that Kennedy, faced with suspicion surrounding his religious affiliation, affirmed his commitment to the ‘absolute’ separation between church and state. <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16920600">Kennedy says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish; where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source; where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials; and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is rather shocking how polemical these words now sound in the present political context. The woeful misunderstanding (or, if you are more cynical) purposeful manipulation by politicians like Santorum has turned Kennedy’s point on its head. While Kennedy was attempting to reassure a majority Protestant country that his religion did not exhaustively define him, Santorum somehow manages to it read it as an ejection of any faith-professing person from the public sphere. He opines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea that the church can have no influence or no involvement in the operation of the state is absolutely antithetical to the objectives and vision of our country. This is a First Amendment – the First Amendment says the free exercise of religion. That means bringing everybody, people of faith and no faith, into the public square.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is laughable to throw the First Amendment in there, as if the right to practice a religion (or no religion) of one’s choosing is identical to its deployment in politics. It is Kennedy’s argument that properly reflects this notion of religious freedom, in that he is asking the public not to hold his (private) faith against him in his quest for (public) office. That said, I have absolutely no doubt that this discourse strikes a rich vein in contemporary America, where a latter-day discomfort with non-Protestants has morphed into a fear of a secular notion of civil governance. Heaven forfend that children find out about <em>that</em> idea in public school! (Which is exactly where the “millions of Americans” whom George Stephanopoulos mentions as having read Kennedy’s speech did so.)</p>

<h3 id="out-of-print">Out of print</h3>
<p>To many on both sides of the political spectrum, it appears that the Republicans are running a 21st-century campaign from a 20th- or even 19th-century playbook. They’ve gotten out-of-date and are going off the rails. This is the argument of Maureen O’Dowd’s latest laughing assessment of the nomination race, in which she dubs the GOP the “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/dowd-ghastly-outdated-party.html">Ghastly Outdated Party</a>,” remarking that is “living posthumously” and “fighting battles on sex, race, immigration and public education long ago won by the other side.” While for many of us these issues do indeed feel settled, it is probably only because we simply don’t feel unsettled by non-procreational sex or same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>Although I think both are defensible in terms of civil rights (right to privacy, right to equality under the law), I don’t trace my personal comfort with these things to an emotionless analysis of the legal questions. I simply don’t feel that there is anything wrong with sex for pleasure or love between two people of the same gender. There is no more explaining this than there is explaining the opposite but equally visceral viewpoint. Or if there is, I’m not going to attempt it.</p>

<p>What I will venture to suppose, however, is that those like Santorum who are offended and worried by the sexual mores of the larger culture are not simply old-fashioned. There is something uniquely modern about their concerns, if for no other reason than the fact that they are having these concerns in a modern world. It is a much different proposition to be against homosexual relationships in today’s world than it was a generation ago, just as it is undeniably different to <em>be</em> in a homosexual relationship now than it was then.</p>

<p>To dismiss people’s discomfort, or fear, or outrage, or bigotry as merely a remnant from a less tolerant time is to mistake the unique nature of the present, which is not simply a more enlightened version of the past, but something wholly new. Many objects and practices morph in ways that simultaneously incorporate the new while maintaining vestiges of the old. And there is even a word for this in the design world: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorph</a>. I am now involved in the production of a magazine that will be read only online, even though I am laying it out using the same type of software I used while managing editor of my college newspaper, which literally ‘went to press’ weekly and was distributed solely in paper copy. (We had email in college, but the Internet was not a daily presence in our academic or personal lives.) The neat websites that exist to ‘publish’ these magazines offer both modern conveniences (internal and external links) and the comforts of old, namely full-screen views that use gradients and shadow to give the look of an open magazine, and even the appropriate sound effect when you ‘turn’ the page.</p>

<p>Even the old can be new again.</p>

<p>Having spent the vast majority of last week ill with a bad cold, Alice’s loyal fans might suspect the mind-altering effects of cold medicine (ah, Claritin, drug of the gods!) behind this announcement: I think everything I want to say about modern culture, I can say in terms of Rick Santorum.</p>

<p>Undeniably, my blogging obsession with this former Senator has been looming for several fortnights, but it was <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/super-pac-super-bad">David Brooks’s banter with Gail Collins</a> in the first print version of their online “Conversation” series that I think really put me over the top. David writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The odd thing is that Santorum seems to be enjoying all this. That’s in part because he has a tropism for the tragic. Most of us look past bad events. We want life to look like our photo albums — a bunch of happy faces, editing out all the bad times. But Santorum seems to dwell on misfortune — the enemies the country faces, the depravity closing in on us, the unfair criticism hurled against him, the terrible things that have happened. When the campaign goes into its fallen state, he has the pleasure of seeing his tragic worldview confirmed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Santorum, the anti-Jack Kennedy Catholic, has a tragic world view? Tragic? Woah. This is big. This is really big. Why, you ask, is this big? Well, mostly because I have devoted a large percentage of my grey matter’s energy over several years to understanding what tragedy means in the modern period, and thus it is no small matter that it is now coalescing, in real time, into what it (classically speaking) was defined against: the salvation of eternal life promised by Christianity.</p>

<p>So my Santorum obsession finally makes sense to me… It’s not just the outrage, it’s not just the fun factor that he represents as the unelectable G.O.P. spoiler. It’s more than that. It’s about larger ideas, ideas to which I have given much thought both in this blog and elsewhere. It might even be a book… I wonder if, when he’s done with the campaign trail, Santorum would grant me an interview? Ah, that really must be the cold medicine making me dream big…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. […] For the unclean they shall take some ashes of the burnt purification offering, and running water shall be added in a vessel; then a clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the furnishings, on the persons who were there, and on whoever touched… the corpse. The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean ones on the third day and on the seventh day, thus purifying them on the seventh day. Then they shall wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and at evening they shall be clean. […] It shall be a perpetual statute for them. The one who sprinkles the water for cleansing shall wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water for cleansing shall be unclean until evening.</p>

<p>The President of the United States has frequently been referred to as the most powerful man on earth. That may perhaps be less true now that America is in a bit of a slump, but nevertheless, the occupier of the American presidency has the temporal authority and resources of few others. Therefore it is perhaps all the more strange to find that one of the men seeking this office this year has a theological world view in which he is cast as profoundly powerless; in fact, the term he uses is rather provocative—it is the term “disabled.”</p>

<p>The history of this term, and the idea the term represents, is diverse and complex. A wonderful book on this subject is that by Henri-Jacques Stiker’s, originally published in French in 1997, but now available in English as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Disability-Corporealities-Discourses/dp/047208626X">A History of Disability</a>. Stiker attempts to paint in broad strokes the general feelings of many ages and cultures around the notion of individual difference within human society, and the book offers a tremendous view into the vastly different ways that human cultures have understood such differences.</p>

<p>This post allows me the space merely to present an example, but I hope it is illustrative of the larger possibilities of this sort of inquiry. In his parallel of the general human condition to that of his disabled child, Santorum is essentializing the notion of disability; he is making it a fundamental attribute of his existence that is not subject to alteration, either by time or through treatment. Leaving aside the many implications of that view, let us note how different this is from the notion of uncleanliness described in the Torah. The foundational books of the Torah reiterate the need to protect the holiness of the encampment of Israel, and in order to do so provides detailed instructions on how to remove uncleanliness from both persons and objects.</p>

<p>If one looks beyond an obsession with bodily emissions and skin imperfections that might seem ignorant to a scientific mind (let alone a feminist one), the remarkable fact (at least it strikes me as so) that remains is the extent to which the return of cleanliness is represented in the most basic turnover of all – the daily setting of the sun. Against this background of the constant resetting of the state of cleanliness, the notion of holiness seems suddenly much more about the efforts of daily reality rather than a fundamental, inalterable state of purity – or defilement. Holiness is like any other aspect of human life, subject to natural risks and responsive to known recourses.</p>

<h3 id="presidential-grief">Presidential Grief</h3>
<p>In her probing post entitled <a href="http://contemporarycondition.blogspot.com/2012/02/making-sense-of-rick-santorum.html">Making Sense of Rick Santorum</a>, Kathy Ferguson (Political Science, University of Hawaii, Manoa) identifies Santorum’s public display and discussion of the grief over the loss of his stillborn son, Gabriel, as what distinguishes his anti-abortion stance from similarly-aligned conservatives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rick Santorum’s public grief, his savage heartbreak over the loss of a child, his exalted loyalty to the remaining disabled child, is exactly the source of his legitimacy over other men who merely oppose abortion. He willingly, exquisitely performs publicly the grief and outrage that the anti-choice women feel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the adoption of this role of public grief over a birth loss, Santorum is assuming a role usually held by anti-choice women, who, Ferguson claims, are often motivated by stories of personal child-related loss. Ferguson notes that “Santorum is the rightful heir of Sarah Palin, whose folksy appeal to right wing women is largely based on the compassion calculus embodied by the quiet Downs Syndrome baby in her arms and the strapping son in military uniform by her side.” This calculus captures an entirely idealized notion of the life-death relationship: Trig, the baby not aborted (as so many Downs fetuses are) represents the refusal to terminate life based on a judgment of disability, while Track’s military service represents the corresponding willingness to sacrifice the able-bodied (no better represented than by young men in uniform) for the ideals of American liberty and freedom.</p>

<p>Ferguson calls this aspect of the conservative cause “violent compassion,” although perhaps ‘militant’ is just as descriptive. Life in this day and age is not something merely natural, it is something that must be willed, valued, and fought for (in hospitals and in legislatures). The role of the medical establishment here cannot be overlooked: the Santorums’s daughter Bella’s survival well beyond the life expectancy of children with Trisomy 18, a disorder much more severe than Downs Syndrome (Trisomy 21), is a testament not merely to the adamance of her parents, but also to an apparently limitless access to high-level medical care.</p>

<p>If every fight needs an enemy, it is easy to cast the medical establishment in this light. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq5no8mHtm0">To hear Santorum tell the story</a> of how the doctor, upon releasing the newborn Bella from the hospital, encouraged the couple to go home without oxygen, saying that they “needed to learn to let go,” it is easy to see the Santorums as courageously battling for Bella’s life with a doctor who is almost callously resigned to her death. Indeed, it is not impossible to see how the Santorums (and others) have extrapolated this heroic view of a personal life/death struggle into the larger cultural realm – a realm in which the medical establishment allows (or in cases of genetic ‘abnormalities,’ encourages) women to abort pregnancies – and have come to the conclusion that they are at fundamental odds with this culture.</p>

<p>In yet another poetic coincidence between the Santorums and the nation’s only Catholic first couple, the Kennedys themselves lost a baby during his time in office: in August 1963, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy was delivered by Caesarian section five and a half weeks early, but died after thirty-nine hours, despite being placed in a hyperbaric chamber to facilitate breathing. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/24/111024fa_fact_groopman">These days</a>, according to Dr. Camilia Martin, a senior neonatologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, the treatment of premature babies has advanced to the point where the survival rate of baby born at Patrick’s gestational age (thirty-two weeks) is nearly 100 percent.</p>

<p>Certainly the battle metaphor for saving young lives was already there in the 1960s; <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70D15FC3F55127B93C2A81783D85F478685F9">the Times, reporting on the grieving First Family</a>, noted that “the battle for the Kennedy baby was lost only because medical science has not yet advanced far enough to accomplish as quickly as necessary what the body can do by itself in its own time.” Medicine can now accomplish amazing things for such babies, but in so accomplishing them, our common understanding of infant death has shifted from that of a devastating yet natural event to an outrageous, unnatural exception. Under this paradigm, the life-endowing abilities of the body are reduced to their essentialist, miraculous components, and amid the rush to grant personhood status to a fertilized egg, we lose the more nuanced understanding of life that used to acknowledge the normal hazards of material, biological development, including miscarriage and infant death. (In addition to Patrick, the Kennedys also had a stillborn daughter.)</p>

<p>While it is of course wonderful that medicine is able to save and ameliorate the lives of more babies than ever before, it seems to have also produced an unfortunate cultural side effect of redefining death as the perversion of life – the result of some sort of lack, be it of technology or of willingness – rather than a natural part of it. Once death is viewed this way, it is all to easy to take sides ‘for’ and ‘against’ it, a thought that one could consider absurd were it not happening before our very eyes: Sarah Palin’s infamous ‘death panels’ are a now classic example of how the ‘socialist,’ ‘elite’ government is defined on the side of death. The ‘battle’ for life is now by necessity political.</p>

<p>From the standpoint that views death as an enemy, all claims about ‘quality of life’ become mere euphemisms for elitism. Only secular elites, people concerned with the ends not the means, the cost not the value, the success not the spirit of the attempt, dare to evaluate the meaning or validity of a life based on its ‘quality’. It is this paradigm that unifies Santorum’s views on birth control and abortion and his strongly negative feelings about higher education, as any emphasis on achievement conflicts with his commitment to love his daughter Bella – who will never attend kindergarden, let alone college – just as much as his other children. What seems like a mystifying, illogical leap to many is consistent with this grief-logic that compels Santorum to reaffirm at every turn his willingness to fight for not only Bella’s life, but also every child like her or potentially like her. That birth-loss – despite the fact that the Santorums have already faced it, and will face it again, inevitably, with Bella – is so unacceptable that it becomes the dominant value of their lives, the dominant metaphor of Santorum’s religion, and the dominant message of Santorum’s politics.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-and-the-body">Thinking (and) the body</h3>
<p>Most disabilities, however, are not faced in such stark philosophical circumstances—they are an aspect of life, but not its dominant component from birth. Indeed, one of the most powerful aspects to the concept of disability (as formulated by the field of Disability Studies) is its permeability. As Lennard J. Davis writes in “Crips Strike Back,” “anyone can become disabled, and in fact, most people will develop impairments with age… Indeed, the acronym TAB (Temporarily Able-Bodied) serves to remind us of the shaky footing on which normalcy rests” (<em>Bending over Backwards</em> 36).</p>

<p>While disability has been and remains the source of much discrimination and segregation, it also has the capacity to evoke a compassion that breaks down barriers between people, particularly those founded on education and intellect. This sort of compassion, which we might call empathetic compassion, is unlike the former kind that seems to congeal into a political crusade. Rather, this compassion has the opposite effect: unable to make any personal distinctions at all surrounding the notions of disability, it reduces everything to the solidarity of struggle against adverse circumstances.</p>

<p>It was this empathetic compassion on display when Tom Gjelten (sitting in for Diane Rehm) <a href="http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-02-27/timothy-snyder-thinking-twentieth-century-tony-judt/transcript">interviewed Timothy Synder</a>, who collaborated with his friend and fellow historian Tony Judt (who was diagnosed in 2008 with ALS) on what would be Judt’s final book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Twentieth-Century-Tony-Judt/dp/1594203237"><em>Thinking the Twentieth Century&lt;</em></a>. The book, an intellectual review of that century’s major political movements and philosophies, took shape from a series of conversations held and recorded between Synder and Judt, a format that Synder proposed in light of the fact that Judt had lost control of his hands and arms and thus could no longer write in the traditional way.</p>

<p>The book is not about his illness, although Judt did write movingly about his condition in <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jan/14/night/?pagination=false">the <em>New York Review of Books</em></a>. But as this caller demonstrates, many people confuse or conflate Tony’s intellectual work product with the unusual conditions in which the book was written.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://thedianerehmshow.org/audio-player?nid=15657">42:45</a>
<strong>RENEE.</strong> This is a brilliant discussion and I want to thank you, Timothy, for coming on the show today. I’m taking notes. I’m almost in tears at some points. You’re speaking to my heart because of the way you’re describing Tony, himself, about accepting his limitations and working within those. […] But this mind, I can’t wait to read the book. I’m a reading teacher, reading skills at a community college here. […] I want to bring this to my students’ attention. But what I wanted to ask, you covered some of it beautifully already, about the emotional part of what he had to deal with, especially that part of the book when you read about his—going to head. But I wonder, Timothy, how did your collaboration begin? Did he ever speak to you personally on this level about his disease on a purely emotionally level?
<strong>GJELTEN.</strong> Well, you said, Timothy, that the book is very much intellectual, that there’s nothing, really, in there about his struggle with the disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although mistaking this book for Tony’s other writings about his terminal condition is perhaps an understandable confusion, the awkwardness of that confusion is consequential, as it lends a rather uncomfortable aspect to Renee’s moving response. She is looking to share Tony’s book with her class, but it is unclear whether it is Tony the intellectual she wants to share or Tony the sufferer of ALS. Gjelten is quick to intervene to set the record straight, of course, but this clarification has the awkwardness of disappointment, as if the intellectual content of the book will not carry the emotion that so moved Renee. One knows for sure that was not the content of the book alone that moved her to call the show.</p>

<h3 id="dismoderism">Dismoderism</h3>
<p>In the first essay in his book, <em>Bending Over Backwards: Disability, Dismodernism and Other Difficult Positions</em>, Lennard J. Davis proposes what he calls dismoderism as the intellectual movement following postmodernism, formulating it as a corrective to the various movements of so-called identity politics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all the hype of postmodern and deconstructive theory, these intellectual attempts made little or no impression on identity politics. Rather, those who pushed identity politics had very strong Enlightenment notions of the universal and the individual. The universal subject of postmodernism may be pierced and narrative-resistant but that subject was still whole, independent, unified, self-making, and capable. The dismodern era ushers in the concept that difference is what all of us have in common. That identity is not fixed but malleable. That technology is not separate but part of the body. That dependence, not individual independence, is the rule. There is no single clockmaker who made the uniform clock of the human body. The watchword of dismodernism could be: Form follows dysfunction. (26-27)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the secular, academic perspective of Davis could not be more different from that of Rick Santorum, it is the latter’s notion of being “disabled” in God’s eyes that is necessary, I believe, to complete the picture of dismodernism. Indeed, from this perspective, it is almost shocking to realize how important a medicalized understanding of the body has become in so-called “religious” contexts. Not terribly long ago, that word could be taken for granted as pertaining not primarily to the body, but to something far beyond it—and thus far more important. Not anymore, it would seem.</p>

<p>Thus to accuse Santorum of <em>religious</em> extremism when he expresses his disgust at the idea of leaving his faith at the door of the Oval Office is not quite fair. Yes, it is clear that he puts his Catholic faith (as he understands it) at the center of his life, and yes, he has no concept of a line between the political realm of guns and butter and the afterhours world of golf—er, NASCAR?—and babies. But this isn’t a case of religion versus secularism, of reactionary conservatives against far-sighted liberals; though it may seem so, this isn’t a throwback to the discussions of an earlier time. This is something different all together, as new to religion as it is to secular intellectual thought.</p>

<p>The body is everywhere. Welcome to the dismodern age.</p>

<p>The sinister nature of both <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/deconstructing-a-demagogue/">Newt’s personality</a> and his <a href="http://loyalopposition.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/catchy-slogans-sloppy-ideas/">campaign tactics</a> have already been detailed. Clearly, he’s got issues with grandiosity, an accusation he wears like a badge of honor as he stokes a crowd until it flames with anger. There never seems to be a shortage of voters who are mad as hell and ready to throw the bastards out, not realizing (or not caring?) that they are voting for the bastards they threw out the time before last. (Or, in this case, the bastard who resigned in disgrace in late 1998.)</p>

<p>I can’t say I understand why dissing Obama as a ‘food-stamp president’ and Gingrich’s encouragement of low-wage jobs for children attracts voters who are, professedly, among the most religious of folk. Perhaps it goes back to the age-old puzzle of the relationship between goodness and fortune; Job gets fed the standard line that the reason for his misfortune must be his wickedness, even if we are told upfront that this is not the case.</p>

<p>Americans seem particularly vulnerable to the myth that good things happen to good people, and the main requirement of goodness in America is hard work with a smile on your face. This is all well and good, if you can find a job, and if that job allows you to keep your dignity. (Work changes its character pretty dramatically in less dignified conditions; just look at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/business/ieconomy-apples-ipad-and-the-human-costs-for-workers-in-china.html">Apple’s factories in China</a>.)</p>

<p>That fortune smiles on the good worker is the fantasy that is promoted every week on the Sunday TV show <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/undercover_boss/">Undercover Boss</a>, where bosses reward enthusiastic employees with amazingly generous bonuses (money, new cars, trips) while tsk-tsking employees who, while perfectly competent at their often grueling jobs, don’t meet the idealistic ‘good attitude’ expectations of the boss.</p>

<p>While the show is often heart-warming, it is sad to see that this is the American idea of charity: gifts meted out by corporate-types to their most ‘deserving’ employees. In the spirit of the left hand not knowing what the right is doing, this isn’t charity, it’s an hour-long commercial. It’s the feel-good complement to Newt’s outrage that low-income people (whose deservingness is not only unknown, but most likely suspect) are receiving food stamps.</p>

<h3 id="i-dont-want-your-freedom">I don’t want your freedom</h3>
<p>On last Sunday’s Undercover Boss, the new president of Kendall Jackson Wines, Rick Tigner, is suddenly moved by the plight of the single mother who doesn’t get health insurance; despite the fact that she works 6 days a week in one of the company’s tasting rooms, she is classed as a part-time employee. Rather than touching, Tigner’s sympathy comes off as ludicrous, given that it is well known that part-time employees are typically not offered the benefits of full-timers.</p>

<p>In the Jacksonville Republican debate, the candidates seemed to agree that the solution to the healthcare crisis was to allow health insurance to be individual, that is, not tied to one’s employment, with Gingrich supporting the idea that individuals be allowed to purchase insurance at the same discount that employers get. In theory, this sounds like a great alternative to the ‘government-run’ healthcare that conservatives decry (except when it’s called ‘Medicare’). The devil is in the details, however: the insurance companies would have to be legally mandated to do this, because clearly if it were advantageous for them to do so now, they would have done so. There’s certainly no law against them doing so. And if you think that they aren’t going to lobby heavily against legislation that would lower their profits, you’ve got another thing coming.</p>

<p>But the most mind-boggling kvetching was done by Rick Santorum, who assailed Romney for the system he helped implement in Massachusetts, under which each resident is mandated to buy insurance (with assistance if needed) or pay a fine to offset the costs incurred by the state for their eventual care (as no hospital can refuse urgent care based on an inability to pay).</p>

<p>As you can see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sj5HcoGK2w&amp;hd=1&amp;t=1h3m3s">in this clip</a>, Santorum gets red in the face with outrage about the fact that “the government is going to mandate you buy something that’s a condition of breathing,” as if ‘Romneycare,’ passed by the state legislature, constituted some sort of constitutional affront—which it indeed may, by the reasoning of our very conservative Supreme Court. We’ll see.</p>

<p>While the argument that the state mandates we do an entire host of things may not pass constitutional muster, it doesn’t make any sense to me why this kind of outrage would woo voters. If you already have health insurance, this issue is moot. And if you don’t, chances are that’s because you can’t afford it, in which case, you’d probably be delighted to receive coverage rather than outraged on grounds of ‘freedom’. And to add insult to injury, this freedom cry is issued by someone who wants to keep many consensual sex acts illegal and make birth control unavailable. What happened to states’ rights now, Rick?</p>

<h3 id="i-believe-in-yesterday">I believe in yesterday</h3>
<p>My favorite person at the debate on Thursday was Ron Paul, who gave us lots of chuckles by calling spades spades. In the discussion on Cuba, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sj5HcoGK2w&amp;t=1h24m10s">Paul spoke from an anti-bogeyman perspective</a> that would have been considered treasonous on a Republican stage even a decade ago.</p>

<p>If Paul wasn’t so set on the gold standard, his down-to-earth perspective on international relations would probably win him a lot of votes. But even if it doesn’t woo anyone, it makes Santorum, in full-blown Communist freakout mode, look plainly paranoid. It also has the effect of rendering rather flaccid Mitt Romney’s main argument against Obama, namely that he believes in American exceptionalism and Obama doesn’t—and that’s what this election is about.</p>

<p>If you ignore the narcissist ambitions of Gingrich and the pseudo-Puritan rantings of Santorum, remaining on stage is Ron Paul calling it like it is and Mitt Romney trying to win the 2012 election with the rhetoric of 1984. It’s not just that he is out of touch, ridiculously wealthy, or doesn’t drink coffee. It’s that he’s out there hawking the Star Wars version of America, where we save the world from evil with our might and freedom.</p>

<p>While Romney will likely win the nomination, he is unlikely to inspire passion in voters, as he’s offering a philosophy that just doesn’t sell anymore. Rebuilding our Navy is not going to solve any of our major problems. We already spend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures">more money on our military than all other nations in the world combined</a>, and while we may have beat the Soviets, lately our might hasn’t been making much right, here or anywhere. Besides, Obama got Osama, so the days of making the Democrats look weak on national security are over.</p>

<p>If the best Republicans have to offer is moon colonies, a bloated military, and the ‘freedom’ not to have healthcare, I think it’s time they considered a new nickname.</p>

<h3 id="boobs-and-babies">Boobs and Babies</h3>
<p>This public reminder that breasts have a “sexual purpose” has got to be the best news of last week. I groaned in bed when NPR reported the government-led violence in Syria and the passage in my new home state of a bill that will require voters to show picture ID at the polls. Such bad news in the morning made me all the more thrilled to hear that evening that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/us/marriage-ban-violates-constitution-court-rules.html">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld</a> (2-1) the California Supreme Court decision regarding the unconstitutionality of Proposition 8 (the referendum that changed the state constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage).</p>

<p>You’ll have to hold fast to your joy, though, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june12/prop8_02-07.html">as you listen to John Eastman</a> (from the National Organization for Marriage) defend the stance that there is no right to same-sex marriage because it is not procreative in the way of opposite-sex marriage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason [for reversal] would be the – the reason would be the right of the people to decide for themselves a very fundamental policy question about whether we’re going to continue to have an institution of marriage that is rooted in biology, with a purpose of procreation, as it always has been, or whether we’re going to allow the courts to mandate a dramatic alteration of that institution, with potentially devastating consequences to society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eastman’s invocation of biology is pretty sloppy—but also pretty crafty. It’s true that procreation requires the meetup of opposite-sex biological components (sperm and egg), but this necessity cannot and does not explain marriage, whose social significance is hardly exhausted by the procreation equation. While the benefits children receive from being raised in a stable, loving, two-parent household are demonstrable, it is laughable to posit that these advantages are inherent in the ‘biological’ procreative potential of man and woman. Even leaving aside the issue of the gender of the parents in question, where does this reductionism leave us in terms of marriages that are either beyond or beside the point of child-bearing and rearing? Is is too dangerous to recall God’s own reasoning in Genesis 2.18—”It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner”—lest it threaten to emphasize marital companionship over copulation?</p>

<p>In Eastman’s mouth, biology becomes a code word for ‘natural’—not that of Darwinian ‘natural selection’ but that of religious ‘natural law,’ scathingly described by <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/the-first-principles-of-rick-santorum/">Molly Worthen</a> on the <em>New York Times</em> website as ”philosophically reasoned prejudice.” Worthen writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evangelicals’ embrace of Santorum illuminates a crucial shift in American political culture: their honeymoon with the Tea Party seems to be over. They have turned away from the cries for small government and liberty—about which they have always been ambivalent—to rekindle their love affair with theocratic Catholicism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Worthen points out, the Tea Partiers’ cry for liberty and ‘strict construction’ of the Constitution was never libertarian in its intents. Rather, “it is an attempt to uncover the immutable, divine will of the Founders — a homegrown version of natural law that would provide grounds for forbidding abortion, same-sex marriage and ‘Obamacare’ in the name of American liberty.” A tenacious, immutable belief in these first principles is the source of Santorum’s otherwise entirely illogical arguments that a healthcare mandate or <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/rick-santorums-anti-college-rant/">the promotion of higher education</a> constitutes an affront to personal freedoms—and why outlawing birth control, abortion, and same-sex marriage does not.</p>

<h3 id="ugly-in-pink">Ugly in Pink</h3>
<p>Being against breast cancer is a failsafe position, safer perhaps even than being pro-parks, or pro-motherhood. Breasts are good, and cancer is bad—enough said. For a lesson in how to screw up something nearly screw-up proof, look no further than the example of the <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/">Susan G. Komen For the Cure</a>, the foundation that announced last week its intention to discontinue its grants to Planned Parenthood, ostensibly because they were cutting funding ties to all organizations under local, state or federal authorities. And besieged Planned Parenthood is indeed under a Congressional investigation, initiated by Representative Cliff Stearns, Republican of Florida, who feels it is a good use of government time and money to make sure that Planned Parenthood really and truly is complying with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment">Hyde Amendment</a>, the rider that has been routinely attached (since 1976!) to appropriation bills that mandates that no federal money go to abortion services.</p>

<p>The political implications of this decision hit Komen like a ton of bricks. The foundation was accused, and rightly so, of bowing to pressure from the anti-choice lobby. Websites and other anti-choice advocates have long criticized the foundation’s support of Planned Parenthood, despite the fact that Komen’s financial support funded only services related to breast health. But the pro-life pressure tactics turned out to be negligible compared to the fallout after the news of non-renewal became public. Donations to Planned Parenthood soared, the blogosphere roared, Congresspersons took notice, and few days later, Komen reversed itself.</p>

<p>This is good news for those who hate to see the anti-choice crowd bully organizations that have no stake in the abortion battle, but for the Komen foundation, the decision is pure pragmatism. Once they discovered that they were losing far more support from everyone else than they would be gaining by pleasing the anti-choice crowd, the reversal was the only logical option. The abortion issue remains divisive, but there is a definite consensus that it is wrong to politicize Komen’s connection to Planned Parenthood. Not only does the organization forward Komen’s mission, but it also provides many essential services to women who otherwise would not have access to them. Ultimately, the good will – and the cash – of this silent majority speaks louder than any protesters in pink.</p>

<h3 id="boobs-and-babes">Boobs and Babes</h3>
<p>I was catching up on <a href="http://www.nbc.com/the-voice/">The Voice</a> the other night when I found out that Whitney Houston had died at 48. At this rate, they ought to start a special ad campaign targeting singers: warning, drugs and alcohol are extremely likely to ruin your career and possibly take your life. I can remember seeing <em>The Bodyguard</em> with my parents when it came out – was it a Christmas movie or is that just my faulty memory? – and thinking how beautiful and talented Houston was, and how untouchable I thought that made her. I would have given useful appendages to be a star like she was. First Amy, now Whitney… The higher they rise, the harder they fall…</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of The Voice is that the initial auditions are blind, and thus the four judges make the decisions whether they would like the singer to join their team based entirely on what they hear. This is a fabulous way to encourage, to the extent that this is possible in today’s image-obsessed world, the separation between talent and looks. Adele and her <a href="http://www.thesundaily.my/news/293539">6 Grammy Awards last night</a>, anyone?</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but let’s not pretend that one of the show’s main attractions isn’t the prominently placed knockers of Christina Aguilera. As the only female judge, perhaps she has an extra responsibility to show cleavage. If so, she’s fulfilling that clause of the contract… to the letter DDD.</p>

<p>If Aguilera can be on national TV with that rack, I don’t see how we’re going to be ruined by snaps of suckling babes. Maybe if we can get Santorum to decry such photos as a liberal elitist plot to force women to breastfeed, Facebook would be humiliated into reversing its silliness.</p>

<p>Just nobody tell Rick that boobs have a sexual purpose, okay? Goodness knows what laws he’ll pass if he finds out!</p>

<p>In case you live in a black hole impenetrable by salacious news, back in April 2003, then-Senator Rick Santorum did an interview with the Associated Press in which he elaborated on his views about the right to privacy, namely, that he believes that no such right exists in the Constitution. At the time, the Court was considering the case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas"><em>Lawrence v. Texas</em></a>, which dealt with the constitutionality of a Texas statute that criminalized consensual sex acts (including anal sex) between people of the same sex. In May that year, the Court ruled (6-3) that the Texas statute was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated due process guarantees. (Justice O’Connor voted with the majority, but wrote a concurring opinion in which she overturned the Texas law not on due process grounds, but those of equal protection.)</p>

<p>While Santorum’s constitutional views are common among those who favor allowing each state to determine the law with regard to such issues as abortion and same-sex marriage, what really upset gay rights activists was Santorum’s cavalier comparison of homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SANTORUM</strong>: We have laws in states, like the one at the Supreme Court right now, that has sodomy laws and they were there for a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family. And if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn’t exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution […] You say, well, it’s my individual freedom. Yes, but it destroys the basic unit of our society because it condones behavior that’s antithetical to strong healthy families. Whether it’s polygamy, whether it’s adultery, where it’s sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that’s what? Children. Monogamous relationships. In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That’s not to pick on homosexuality. It’s not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality —</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>AP</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t think I was going to talk about “man on dog” with a United States senator, it’s sort of freaking me out.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SANTORUM</strong>: And that’s sort of where we are in today’s world, unfortunately. The idea is that the state doesn’t have rights to limit individuals’ wants and passions. I disagree with that. I think we absolutely have rights because there are consequences to letting people live out whatever wants or passions they desire. And we’re seeing it in our society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response, the gay sex-columnist Dan Savage—who, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/infidelity-will-keep-us-together.html">despite his innovative views on what he considers an unhealthy American obsession with marital fidelity</a>, is very much pro-family, and has a son with his partner—ended up, at the suggestion of a reader, sponsoring a create-an-insult competition to permanently associate Santorum’s name with his anti-gay stance. The winning entry is the definition you see above. Oh, and it ~is~ was until very recently the first entry you see (below Santorum’s paid ad) <a href="http://searchengineland.com/how-rick-santorum-is-making-his-google-problem-worse-106665">when you google his name</a>.</p>

<p>I know repeating this gross insult on my blog violates the golden rule of doing to others as you would have done to you. Yet I choose to do so because there is something deeply satisfying about seeing a politician who would make his bigoted views against gays and lesbians a central aspect of his Presidential campaign get his cyberspace ‘cum’uppance. Bigots should be allowed their opinions and their rights to speak them openly should be protected. But they should also expect to be answered with equal venom.</p>

<h3 id="poetic-justice">Poetic, Justice</h3>
<p>It is important to note the care with which this winning definition was crafted. Here is the letter containing the suggestion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I agree with the spirit of naming something objectionable (to him) after Rick Santorum, I think it should be a substance, not an act. I would never want to “santorum” anyone I liked. What a turnoff. Instead, I think it would be better to name some kind of sexual byproduct after him. After all, ending up with idiots like Santorum in elected office is a byproduct of the otherwise desirable practice of letting any old yokel vote. Specifically, I nominate the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex. As in, “We had a great time, but we got santorum all over the sheets.” Or better yet, “Before I sodomize my gay, unmarried dog, I like to give him an enema so there won’t be any santorum.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the heart of this reader’s reasoning are two salient issues. First, the term must be offensive to Santorum but not to those who are expected to popularize it. In this sense, could be considered a sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation">reappropriation</a>, or rather, to neologize punningly, <em>fauxpropriation</em>. It is an ironic appropriation because, as the examples given by the suggester already make clear, the point is not to introduce a term to describe a substance, but rather to assign and popularize a convenient, derogatory shorthand for Rick Santorum’s anti-gay political platform.</p>

<p>Second, the term is coined in the spirit of the ambivalence of the principles and processes of democracy, an ambivalence that goes to the heart of the issues raised by the original controversy. In theory, letting each person have a vote is a good idea, because it allows each of us to feel represented and therefore somehow equally empowered. In practice, however—and historically there was a lot more anxiety about this—democracy is just a fancy word for mob rule. Indeed, there is no end of horrible things that the sacrosanct non-entity known as ‘the American people’ has believed in and voted for during the short lifespan of this unlikely republic.</p>

<p>This ambivalent <em>fauxpropriation</em> is the contemporary metamorphosis of the literary figure known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_justice">poetic justice</a>. The law of poetic justice demands that virtue be rewarded and evil punished. But the fact is, we no longer live in an age where we can all agree on the story we are telling, and thus what is virtue and what is vice. I have no qualms calling Rick Santorum a bigot because he believes that homosexual acts and gay marriage should be illegal in states where the residents prefer that it be so. Not only does he not care that I call him a bigot, on his <a href="http://www.ricksantorum.com/champion-faith-families">campaign website</a> he anticipates that I will do so, and wears it as a badge of honor, labeling me with the appropriate corresponding epithet—liberal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When activist judges took it upon themselves to redefine marriage, and with it the underpinnings of the traditional American family and our First Amendment right to Freedom of Religion, Rick spearheaded the debate in favor of Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004. Rick successfully fought even members of his own Party and had the amendment brought to the Senate floor for public debate in two successive Congresses. Even though he knew he would be labeled a bigot or worse by members of the liberal elite, Rick Santorum understood this issue was far too important to the future of our society not to be debated before the American public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From an evangeliconservative viewpoint, risking the label of bigotry is the sign of courage of a true defender of American values against liberals who espouse a dangerous live-and-let-live philosophy, and the activist judges who would impose this philosophy on everyone else. If the waters aren’t muddied enough already, consider another exchange in that same <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm">2003 interview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re saying that liberalism is taking power away from the families, how is conservatism giving more power to the families?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SANTORUM:</strong> Putting more money in their pocketbook is one. The more money you take away from families is the less power that family has.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is something downright bizarre about Santorum’s entirely uncynical embrace of money as the force of good in this country. And it is absolutely mind-boggling how this promiscuous attitude toward wealth has wound up in such a tight embrace with pseudo-Puritan attitudes about sex. But this is what conservatism is these days, unless you are Ron Paul (who is only a conservative when it comes to getting on TV—really he’s a libertarian). Santorum, like his fellow conservatives, is all for the free, unfettered flow of money, as if it is a magical, moral fluid. Money is a way we can express and empower ourselves without fear of excess or decadence. The more money, the better, not only to each family, but also (as we are now seeing) in the form of ‘free speech’ in political campaigns. The bonus with Santorum is that he understands the importance not only of cutting your taxes, but also of restoring morality by taking away your birth control. Yes, you read that right—he believes that even for married people, non-procreative sex is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2011/10/19/348007/rick-santorum-pledges-to-defund-contraception-its-not-okay-its-a-license-to-do-things/?mobile=nc">counter to the way things are supposed to be</a>. And the way things are “supposed to be” is what, Rick—<a href="http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/19-kids-and-counting">19 Kids and Counting</a>?</p>

<h3 id="slippery-slopes">Slippery slopes</h3>
<p>With more money for all and ejaculate safely squirting into the conjugal vaginas of fertile women, America will rise again. This is so ridiculous that to call this attitude conservative, in the sense of returning to a slate of old values, would be to insult more dead people than I dare. The Duggars have nothing in common with colonial Puritans; the Quiverfull <em>lifestyle choice</em> (!) they exemplify is only possible in an age of modern medicine and Child Tax Credits.  (And did you know, Rick, that the ‘father’ of this country, George Washington, was himself sterile, and never had any genetic offspring?)</p>

<p>It is easy to mistake Santorum’s ‘conservative’ stance as traditional, however, because Christianity (or those perhaps who speak most loudly in its name) has historically condemned homosexuality. (Please note: I am not picking on Christianity or Christians here. There are plenty of Christian denominations that do not condemn gays and lesbians; there are other religions that do condemn homosexuality. Furthermore, there are members of all religions who, despite the dogma of their chosen faith, are not homosexist.) But Rick Santorum is not taking us back to the 1920s, the 1620s, or any time in between. Even Dante, to roll back to the 1320s, would recognize neither the postmodern cult of extreme liquidity nor that of extreme fertility. In his version of hell, sodomites are punished along with the usurers – the former sinning against nature (God’s offspring), the latter against industry and economy (nature’s offspring, so God’s grandchildren). Dante was strict all the way around; these days, Santorum and his brethren seem way more eager to decry gay marriage than to condemn the rapacity and corruption on Wall Street. Am I the only one to think that Wall Street, not same-sex coupledom, is responsible for the mess of our economy?</p>

<p>Maybe it is because Dante is long dead that I don’t think of him a homosexist – or, for that matter, an anti-Semite, both of which he probably was, in perfect concert with his time and place. Really, I don’t think of him as anything except a poet, even though he was what we liberal elites would call <em>engagé</em>. He cared deeply about the temporal society in which he lived, and he had, needless to say, very strong opinions. (It really doesn’t get much stronger than putting people you disagree with into a graphically detailed infernal afterlife.)</p>

<p>Instead, when I was summarizing the etymology of the new meaning of santorum for my cousin, the word I reached for was one I learned while studying the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. For the spreading of santorum is a lovely contemporary example of <em>contrapasso</em>, that is, of an appropriate correspondence between sin on earth and punishment in hell. Here, of course, I fauxpropriate the term, as I am condemning not men who love men, or women who love women, but people who would condemn them for doing so.</p>

<p>And the only uncomfortable eternity to which I sentence Santorum is the unforgiving memory of Google.</p>

Nowadays, the world talks.</p> <h4 id="movie-producer-zimmer-inthe-artist">—movie producer Zimmer, in <em>The Artist</em></h4> </blockquote> <h3 id="words-unheard">Words unheard</h3> <p><em>The Artist</em> tells a poignant love story set against the changing world of Hollywood in the 1920s and 30s. This May-August romance between Peppy Miller and George Valentin begins accidentally, as the unknown Peppy steals George’s spotlight after a movie premiere. The next day, as her photograph is all over the papers, she gets herself cast as an extra in George’s latest formula flick, “A German Affair.” While the script calls for him to briefly dance with her, we see in take after take the evolution of a mutual feeling between them, something undefined but powerful.</p> <p>From <a href="http://twcguilds.com/assets/screenplay/the-artist.pdf">the script</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The scene is shot several times from three different angles. Each time, George dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport changes. To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then, with time, less so.

<h3 id="words-unheard">Words unheard</h3>
<p><em>The Artist</em> tells a poignant love story set against the changing world of Hollywood in the 1920s and 30s. This May-August romance between Peppy Miller and George Valentin begins accidentally, as the unknown Peppy steals George’s spotlight after a movie premiere. The next day, as her photograph is all over the papers, she gets herself cast as an extra in George’s latest formula flick, “A German Affair.” While the script calls for him to briefly dance with her, we see in take after take the evolution of a mutual feeling between them, something undefined but powerful.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://twcguilds.com/assets/screenplay/the-artist.pdf">the script</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scene is shot several times from three different angles. Each time, George dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport changes. To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then, with time, less so. Then they become embarrassed, and then things get worse. We start the sequence again and again, to the sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes, but the eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from the scene, every thing else goes unnoticed. Ultimately, no flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing. It’s probably love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peppy’s reveals her feelings in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmPt9il-Tdo">brilliant scene that follows</a>. (Make sure you have the volume up to hear the music.) Not finding George in his dressing room, she sees his coat and top hat on the coat rack. Placing her arm through one sleeve, her arm seems to become his arm, and she proceeds to expertly pantomime—and respond to—what appears to be his hand caressing her. Wordlessly, she has conveyed her longing; alone, she has expressed the erotic charge between herself and the man she desires—a message not lost on George who then enters the room.</p>

<p><em>The Artist</em> is a silent film, but it is mindfully and purposefully silent, retrofitting (literally) this genre for the purposes of metacinematic commentary. References to the act of talking abound, be it in the context of refusal or inability to speak, or a need or a wish to talk, or in the literal context of the technological change at the core of the film: the advent of the talkies. Though the world of film brings Peppy and George together, it also soon divides them, as Peppy begins to rise through the ranks at Kinograph Studios, which has just ceased production on silent films—as they were suddenly retronymically named—to devote itself to the talkies, the obvious future of the industry. George is accordingly let go from Kinograph, thus ending the possibility of collaboration between himself and his might-be sweetheart (he’s married, but not too happily).</p>

<p>At first, George fails to read the writing on the wall—after he is let go by Kinograph, he pours his own money into a film of his own direction, determined that he can still draw the crowds. Both his “Tears of Love” and Peppy’s first major film, “Beauty Spot,” are scheduled to open on Friday, October 25. But in the wake of the Wall Street Crash (beginning Oct. 24, 1929, “Black Thursday”), the lines are for Peppy Miller’s talkie rather than George’s retro opus. While George’s public abandons him, dismissing him as part of the past, Peppy remains loyal, watching the film in an empty theater and stopping by his house to tell him how much she enjoyed it. She is the exception, however, as Peppy’s companion explains that his father was George’s fan, rather than him. Even George enjoys the innovation of the talkies, later watching Peppy as “The Guardian Angel” in a packed theater. (It’s rather curious to watch an audience watch a talkie in a silent film; the internal audience ‘hears’ while we do not, and we suddenly appreciate that certain aspects of cinema are actually lost with the innovation of recorded audio.)</p>

<h3 id="words-unspoken">Words unspoken</h3>
<p>When his wife Doris declares she’s had enough (“We have to talk,” goes that dreaded line, both sad and comic in this context), George’s bust is complete—he is passé, broke, and headed toward divorce. Told by Doris to pack his things and go, he spirals into poverty and depression, drowning his sorrows in drink. Soon he can no longer afford to keep his old furniture or the collectables relating to his career, and must auction them all off. His self-pity increasing in proportion to his desperation, he forcibly dismisses his aging butler-chauffeur, Clifton, who has loyally remained with him despite not having been paid for an entire year.</p>

<p>Alone (save for his adorable Jack Russell, Jack) and embittered, George hits bottom one day watching his own movies in his empty apartment. George flies into a rage and begins to break open the cans of film (the only thing he seems to have kept) and crazily unspools the reels. In a sea of celluloid, he then lights a match. As anyone who has seen <em>Cinema Paradiso</em> will recall, old film was extremely flammable, and so we understand that George is suicidal. Indeed, as the fire soon rages out of control, he crawls into the corner to die.</p>

<p>Jack, appreciating the danger and unable to coax George to flee with his barking, runs down the street and manages (with the help of a passing woman) to convince the corner policeman to follow him and rescue his master. In the hospital, where Peppy rushes from the set as soon as she hears the news, she recognizes the one reel of film that George saved from the flames as the outtakes from “A German Affair”—the only footage of them together.</p>

<p>She moves the still-sleeping George to her mansion to continue his recovery. His pride, however, makes him a grudging recipient of her kindness, even though Clifton—who now works for Peppy, of course—attempts to convince him of her well-meaningness when he delivers a script from her. This movie, which Peppy has blackmailed Zimmer into agreeing to, will co-star George. But George is too determined to feel bad for himself to even read the script, and once he discovers that Peppy was the purchaser of all his goods at auction, he leaves in a fury.</p>

<p>Back in his burned-out apartment, George removes a gun from its box to finally kill himself. Peppy, however, arrives in time to convince him to accept the possibility of his own redemption. For <em>The Artist</em> is precisely a film of redemption, in the sense of continuity and recuperation. George is convinced that the technological change of the talkies has rendered him a failure, having destroyed his fame and also his personal value, even his worthiness of being loved. Peppy finally convinces George that far from being washed up and unlovable, the present (meaning both her and the world of the talkies) does not demand anything of him that he is not. George does not need to learn to do what we are repeatedly shown he cannot do—find his voice. In other words, he does not need to change himself, he need only drop his attitude of pride and self-pity in order to embrace—as Peppy has always done—who he already is.</p>

<h3 id="words-left-unsaid">Words left unsaid</h3>
<p>Although Peppy and George have felt strong feelings for one another from the beginning, this love is never openly declared in words, not even during the dramatic rescue scene near the movie’s end. Instead, Peppy tells George she feels awful that he has taken her actions so badly: she confesses that she merely wanted to help him, to care for him. They embrace, but that is as romantic as the language gets. Which is fitting, not only for the expectations of the time period (this is, wink wink, the 1930s), but also for their relationship, which has itself developed largely in separation and in silence, rather than amidst the drama-filled wordiness of contemporary communication. Peppy makes no confessions of love, but simply serves George through her kindness, supporting him anonymously by buying his possessions and nursing him after the fire.</p>

<p>Accordingly, George’s redemption—and the film’s happy ending—comes from a different source than that of today’s typical romantic comedy. This latter is often predicated on a fallacious fantasy: the heroine gets her formerly reprobate man after her love motivates him to reform. (A recent decent movie based on this premise is <em>Crazy. Stupid. Love</em>. A less-recent and stunningly awful movie based on this premise is <em>Something Borrowed</em>.) In <em>The Artist</em>, Peppy never demands that George change to merit her, as he has never wronged her, only himself. Instead of demanding, Peppy perseveres—not so that George can change, but so that he can awaken.</p>

<p>George, in accepting Peppy’s help, accepts the possibility that there is still a place for him on the silver screen: no longer as the independent hero, but as the dance partner of Peppy—dancing being, as we have seen, something they both do terrifically well. As the film concludes with a take of their tap number, suddenly the audio is added, and the first sound we hear is the lovers’ labored breath, as both Peppy and George are winded from the effort. (Another hint, perhaps, that a tap dance is truly the early-movie-era substitute for the love scene, as noted by director Michel Hazanavicius in a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2011/12/05/111205ta_talk_friend">brief interview in 5 Dec. 2011’s New Yorker</a>.) As the film emerges for the first time into a full-audio world—and in the context of making a movie, no less!—we realize that in a very important sense, there was never any such thing as the world of silent film, as stage sets both then and now are full of sound. The retronym seems more a technical term describing a recording process than an aesthetic description of an actor’s or filmgoer’s experience.</p>

<p>Like George and Peppy, we have heard all that is necessary in our hearts.</p>

<h3 id="reason-for-the-season">Reason for the Season</h3>
<p>The end of the year is a traditional time to take stock of the 365 previous days, and as good a chance as any to gear up for the next solar go-round. Not that the everyday business of living and dying ceases, though. Indeed, the final fortnight of 2011 has seen the death of several notable persons, including the above-quoted Christopher Hitchens.</p>

<p>Hitchens was a polemicist, someone who enjoyed not only sharing his opinion as an author and journalist, but also sparring with others as a commentator and speaker on television, where his wit and willingness put him in high demand. He had ideals, but he was too catholic in his critiques to be considered an ideologue. He wrote a book on Mother Teresa entitled <em>The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice</em>. He was, as William Grimes puts it in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html">New York Times obit</a>, “an equal-opportunity abuser.”</p>

<p>Much was made of the fact that Hitchens was an outspoken atheist, a position which he elaborated in the best-selling 2007 book <em>God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything</em>. You have to admire someone who gets up on that particular soapbox in America, the country he adopted as his home in 1981. Despite the notable discretion of the founding fathers on this issue, these days, it is for all intents and purposes impossible to engage in presidential politics without at least giving credible lip-service to religious faith.</p>

<p>In a country where atheism has progressed from visceral associations with the anti-American politics of the left (think McCarthy and the Red Scare) to virulent accusations of leftist, corporatist conspiracies (think Glenn Beck and <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/201011090036" target="_blank">his anti-Semitic attack on George Soros</a>), Hitchens is not only brave but battle-savvy. He wasn’t the kind of dovish liberal that hawks love to pigeonhole: he broke with the International Socialists in 1982 to support the Falklands War, and later came out in favor of the invasion of Iraq – a view that led to his break with the left-wing weekly <em>The Nation, </em>for which he was a long-time correspondent.</p>

<p>For Hitchens, religion was indelibly associated with the things he hated: dictatorship, stupidity, censorship. He believed in the threat of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamofascism" target="_blank">Islamofascism</a>” – a term he popularized though denied coining. He once quipped to Sean Hannity, who was trying to make a case for an all-seeing God: “It would be like living in North Korea.” Those who hoped (to Hitchens’ great amusement) that his illness would prompt a late-life conversion clearly misinterpreted his atheism as a lack of passion, unable to see the strength he gained from a hard-thought rejection of dogma, the solace he took in being his own man.</p>
<h3>Gifted</h3>
<p>As this will be my final post of 2011, I couldn’t help taking a scroll down short-term memory lane. This has been a transformative year for the blog, the year in which I started a biweekly posting cycle that seems to suit me and the variety of writing circumstances in which I have found myself this year. Rereading my reflections on current events – whether global or personal in scale – I realize how much I enjoy the regular challenge of putting together a piece on a reasonably short, self-imposed deadline.</p>

<p>In the spirit of acknowledging the pleasures of personal pursuits, it seems appropriate to follow up on <a href="http://www.lightthetunnel.net/?p=78">my midyear reflections about the “room of my own,”</a> namely, the tremendous opportunity I have had for the last six months to devote a large amount of time to pursuing the arts I love: writing and making music.</p>

<p>These passions are hardly new to me, but for a variety of reasons, my relationship to them has altered significantly over the last calendar year. Perhaps I should acknowledge here the fact that I understand the role of activities in my life similar to the way I do my interactions with people; while such a personification may seem odd to some, for me it feels entirely natural.</p>

<p>The love of words and music have always been present in my life, but we haven’t always gotten along very well. I have come to understand that there is a crucial difference between a love you profess and a love you inhabit. The loves we profess, too easily we postpone them and place them on pedestals; they become what we will attend to when we have time, or when the circumstances are right. We love them so much that we feel unprepared for or unworthy of them now.</p>

<p>An inhabited love is different. The loves we inhabit are not vulnerable to being sullied by imperfection, haste, or foul weather (of the mood or meteorological varieties). We can come in from the rain and wipe our muddy shoes on these loves; like a doormat, they mark the entrance to our homely spaces, ready to receive us however we arrive. Below our feet as they are, though, we often forget to realize the gift that is the ground. It is easy to feel outdone by the possibilities whirling around our eyes.</p>

<p>Such freedom of opportunity I have always enjoyed. I was raised in the spirit of self-determination, and in the fortunate circumstances that render that premise more than an empty promise. But this autonomy is different than the freedom of self-permission, a willingness that often eludes even those (like myself) of considerable privilege.</p>

<p>Amidst all these advantages I forgot how to be willing to do what I loved, and gradually I almost forgot that I loved it. I decided I would love instead what the world told me I was good at, in the hopes that I could become one of those enviable people who loved her job. I was practical, restrained, reasonable.</p>

<p>And suddenly I was all alone. This “world” was something I had imagined; it was merely the reified echo of the institutions that had formed my intellect. Like a bus, this so-called world could take me across town, but it couldn’t provide a motivation for the trip. I got off because it was the end of the line, still lacking a destination.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>Looking down at my feet, then, these last six months, I finally stared in the face the difference between being able to do what I love and being free to do so.</p>

<p>Doing what you love is not the same as getting what you want, or even doing what you want. Getting what you want is about power and control, whereas doing what you love requires you to surrender both. Doing what you want is about willfulness, which often sabotages rather than encourages the willingness we need to do what we love. It is a cop-out in the place of an opt-in.</p>

<p>I used to think that doing what I loved required drawing a line in the sand, a new point of departure after which everything would be different. I wanted to change myself in the hopes that I could be more creative, not recognizing that it was creative practice that would be the source, rather than the result, of change.</p>

<p>I’d be lying if I claimed that all circumstances are equally conducive to creative activity; nevertheless, I no longer believe that one’s ideal circumstances have to be realized in advance of creative effort. While devoting all of one’s time to art is circumstantial, and remains a luxury few of us have for long (if at all), devoting oneself to what one loves does not require a blank slate or an empty calendar. The best art is interstitial, filling in all of life’s cracks, expanding into the various chasms in our hearts and minds, those fashioned by wonder as well as woe, etched by the delights as well as the disappointments of this mad, mad world.</p>

<p>I don’t have a plan for 2012. I’m looking forward to it.</p>

<p><em>A Room of One’s Own</em>, like many useful books, is of its own time and also timeless. I almost laugh while reading of women being denied access to the library at Oxbridge (lacking the company of a fellow of the College or a letter of introduction), and doing without the lush amenities, gastronomic and residential, provided by the largess of the richer (male) institutions. How different is the state of higher education today, particularly in America, where women not only attend the Ivy League Institutions, but also have decisively <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/01/26/gender">outnumbered men in terms of college attendance</a> for over 10 years now. But it is a wry laughter, for although the balance of access has shifted, at the same time the game has changed, and as the saying goes, the more things change, the more they remain the same. Women, despite going from total exclusion to (at least) demographic dominance in the academy, do not seem to have gained an advantage from this shift. Don’t get me wrong – I don’t mean to say that for the women who have received educational access, including myself, that there is no difference between then and now. Of course there is. But as a group, it seems, women still suffer distinct disadvantages, despite have gone from under- to overrepresented in institutions of higher education. For instance, it can actually be <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/03/27/admit"><em>easier</em> for boys to get into college these days</a>, because they are considered a desirable quantity, a coveted <em>minority.</em> Off campus, and overall, women are still the minority-that-is-not-one that we have always been. Meaning we are not a minority (constituting as we do 50% or more of the population) and that the historical (and present) discrimination against us (by women <em>and</em> men) has nothing to do with percentages but with power. Discrimination can just as easily occur against the majority, as in the case of apartheid in South Africa and in many countries today where the rulers belong to a distinct group (ethnic, religious, tribal, what have you) than the population they rule. But I digress. Point is, <a href="http://www.iwpr.org/initiatives/pay-equity-and-discrimination/#about">women still earn 77 cents on the male dollar</a>, and we are significantly underrepresented in positions of power, whether that be in the halls of government, military, business, or academia. Although Woolf is not here to wax elegantly satirical about the current state of affairs, she has already identified the true problem, and provided the solution. The solution, for the woman who would write, is not to be angry at the world that has limited her opportunities, and it is financial and physical freedom that can assuage this bitterness. Mary Benton describes her emotional transition from working woman to independent writer upon receiving her windfall. (Ellipses and paragraphing are mine.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need not, I am afraid, describe in any detail the hardness of the work …; nor the difficulty of living on the money when it was earned… But what still remains with me as a worse infliction than either was the poison of fear and bitterness which which those days bred in me. To begin with, always to be doing work that one did not wish to do, and to do it like a slave, flattering and fawning, not always necessarily perhaps, but it seemed necessary and the stakes were too great to run risks; and the thought of that one gift which it was death to hide… perishing and with it myself, my soul – all this became like rust eating away the bloom of the spring, destroying the tree at its heart. However, as I say, my aunt died; and whenever I change a ten-shilling note a little of that rust and corrosion is rubbed off; fear and bitterness go… Therefore not merely do effort and labour cease, but also hatred and bitterness. I need not hate any man; he cannot hurt me. I need not flatter any man; he has nothing to give me. So imperceptibly I found myself adopting a new attitude towards the other half of the human race. It was absurd to blame any class or any sex, as a whole. Great bodies of people are never responsible for what they do…. They too, the patriarchs, the professors, had endless difficulties, terrible drawbacks to contend with…. True, they had money and power, but only at the cost of harbouring in their breasts an eagle, a vulture… the instinct for possession, the rage for acquisition which drives them to desire other people’s fields and goods perpetually… These are unpleasant instincts to harbour, I reflected… And, as I realized these drawbacks, by degrees fear and bitterness modified themselves into pity and toleration; and then in a year or two, pity and toleration went, and the greatest release of all came, which is freedom to think of things in themselves. That building, for example, do I like it or not? Is that picture beautiful or not? Is that in my opinion a good book or a bad? Indeed my aunt’s legacy unveiled the sky to me, and substituted for the large and imposing figure of a gentleman, which Milton recommended for my perpetual adoration, a view of the open sky.</p>

<p>Recently, I have read Michelle Alexander’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595581030/">The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness</a>.</em> While this book is certainly not the first to address the issue of the exploding prison population in recent decades or its disproportionate impact on non-white men (“black and brown” is the term Alexander frequently uses), it promulgates an original and provocative thesis that this imprisonment constitutes the latest form of race-based social control, following slavery and Jim Crow. While I believe that mass incarceration is a disgrace of our society, and all the more so because of its disproportional destruction of the lives, liberties, and pursuits of public happiness of racial minorities, it turns out that imprisonment is only one part of the story of confinement in America, and that when you consider asylums and mental institutions, you understand that institutionalization has long been a part of our social system. From the abstract of <a href="http://bernardharcourt.com/">Bernard E. Harcourt</a>’s 2006 article “<a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/institutionalized-final.pdf">From the Asylum to the Prison: Rethinking the Incarceration Revolution</a>”:</p>

  <p>When the data on mental hospitalizations rates are combined with the data on imprisonment rates for the period 1928 through 2000, the incarceration revolution of the late twentieth century barely reaches the level of aggregated institutionalization that the United States experienced at mid-century. The highest rate of aggregated institutionalization during the entire period occurred in 1955 when almost 640 persons per 100,000 adults over age 15 were institutionalized in asylums, mental hospitals, and state and federal prisons. (p. 1751)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have access to JSTOR, you can read the <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/10.1086/658404">latest edition of Harcourt’s research</a>, where he discovers to have actually underestimated these figures, and concludes that “the aggregated institutionalization rates (in all mental hospitals and prisons) between 1936 and 1963 consistently exceeded 700 persons per 100,000 adults” with peaks of 760 in 1955, 757 in 1954, and 756 in 1948 (p. 6-7).] The main difference then, between confinement then and now, is not the tendency to confine, but the demographics of the institutionalized population. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/15/opinion/15harcourt.html">Harcourt explains in an op-ed piece</a> in the New York Times from 2007:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1937, women represented 48 percent of residents in state mental hospitals. In contrast, new prison admissions have consistently been 95 percent male. Also, the mental health patients from the 1930s to the 1960s were older and whiter than prison inmates of the 1990s. But the graph poses a number of troubling questions: Why did we diagnose deviance in such radically different ways over the course of the 20th century? Do we need to be imprisoning at such high rates, or were we right, 50 years ago, to hospitalize instead? Why were so many women hospitalized? Why have they been replaced by young black men? Have both prisons and mental hospitals included large numbers of unnecessarily incarcerated individuals? Whatever the answers, the pendulum has swung too far — possibly off its hinges.</p>

<h3 id="a-class-action">A Class Action</h3>

<p>Which brings me to Wal-Mart. Last week, the court issued its <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-277.pdf">decision</a> rejecting the formation of a nationwide class of 1.5 million female employees of Wal-Mart for the purposes of a class action lawsuit contending sex-based discrimination in promotion and pay practices. While the Court did not rule on the merits of the discrimination case itself – i.e., it did not issue a finding about the existence of discriminatory practices at Wal-Mart – the majority (5-4, with the three female justices on the Court joining the minority dissent) decision has the effect of making it much more difficult for women to sue Wal-Mart over discriminatory practices. As can well be imagined, the inability to sue as a nationwide class will diminish the chances that any lawsuits will be brought, given that it takes huge resources to sue a giant corporation such as Wal-Mart, and that, absent the class action status, firms will no longer be motivated by the potentially large legal fee awards to accept such cases on contingency. The formation of a legal “class” in federal court is governed by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23</a>. Section (a) establishes the necessary prerequisites to establishing a class:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scalia, writing for the majority, focused on the second of these prerequisites, ruling that the respondents had failed to demonstrate that the grievances they identified in their individual cases were applicable to all female employees. In order to qualify as a class for the purposes of legal action, the plaintiffs must bridge the “conceptual gap” between an individual’s experience and a general standard of treatment. The Court found that they had failed to do so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second manner of bridging the gap requires “significant proof “ that Wal-Mart “operated under a general policy of discrimination.”  That is entirely absent here. Wal-Mart’s announced policy forbids sex discrimination… The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs’ evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-Mart’s “policy” of <em>allowing discretion</em> by local supervisors over employment matters. On its face, of course, that is just the opposite of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action; it is a policy <em>against having</em> uniform employment practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Court does not rule out the possibility of a possible discrimination claim in an environment of local discretion, but rather rules that the plaintiffs have not proven that it exists in the Walmart instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the recognition that this type of Title VII claim “can” exist does not lead to the conclusion that every employee in a company using a system of discretion has such a claim in common.  To the contrary, left to their own devices most managers in any corporation and <strong>surely</strong> most managers in a corporation that forbids sex discrimination would select sex-neutral, performance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no <strong>actionable disparity</strong> at all. (Boldface mine.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely. Surely? Why is Scalia so sure? Why is he so sure that, in an organization where women fill 70% of the hourly jobs and only 33% of managerial positions, that, even if sex discrimination in promotion does occur, <em>it is not going to be prevalent enough</em> to produce the kind of disparity that is entitled <em>to even petition</em> for relief as a class. It is this sureness to which Justice Ginsburg objects to in her dissent (joined by Justices Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), in which she draws attention to the word “question” in Rule 23(a)(2).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A “question” is ordinarily understood to be “[a] subject or point open to controversy.”  American Heritage Dictionary 1483 (3d ed. 1992).  See also Black’s Law Dictionary 1366 (9th  ed. 2009) (defining “question of  fact” as “[a] disputed issue to be resolved … [at] trial” and “question of law” as “[a]n issue to be decided  by the judge”).  Thus,  a ”question” “common to the class” must be a dispute, either of fact or of law, the resolution of which will advance the determination of the class members’ claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, Ginsburg believes that the majority has misinterpreted the prerequisite of commonality, setting the threshold too high.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The plaintiffs’ allegations state claims of gender discrimination in the form of biased decision making in both pay and promotions.  The evidence reviewed by the District Court adequately demonstrated that resolving those claims would necessitate examination of particular policies and practices alleged to affect, adversely and globally, women employed at Wal-Mart’s stores.  Rule 23(a)(2), setting a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for class action certification, demands nothing further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question she wishes to allowed to be asked, Scalia has already answered. By the ruling, Ginsburg writes, “[t]he Court disqualifies the class at the starting gate.”</p>

<h3 id="the-looking-glass-ceiling">The (Looking) Glass Ceiling</h3>

<p>Fundamentally, the difference between Scalia and Ginsburg’s opinions is the willingness to examine the relationship between a policy and a reality, between opportunity on paper and opportunity in daily life. The majority’s confidence that Wal-Mart’s policies – <em>despite</em> uncontested evidence of widespread pay differences between men and women, and the latter’s underrepresentation in higher-level positions – are not legally challengeable by women as a class throws us back upon our regrettable status as the minority-that-is-not-one. We have been let into the library, the electorate, the workforce, the boardroom… so, he says, how can you say that you are not equal if we say you are no longer lesser?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But… may I remind you that there have been at least two colleges for women in existence in England since the year 1866; that after the year 1880 a married woman was allowed by law to possess her own property; and that in 1919 – which is a whole nine years ago – she was given a vote? May I also remind you that the <em>[sic]</em> most of the professions have been open to you for close on ten years now? When you reflect upon these immense privileges and the length of time during which they have been enjoyed, and the fact that there must be at this moment some two thousand women capable of earning over five hundred a year in one way or another, you will agree that the excuse of lack of opportunity, training, encouragement, leisure and money no longer holds good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Woolf is, of course, waxing satirical, giving preemptive voice to the male criticism she feels her suggestions in <em>A Room of One’s Own</em> will prompt. Scalia, however, is not satirical at all. And were <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/exchange/result_exchall.php?action=&amp;iyear=1929&amp;dyear=2008&amp;ivalue=500&amp;itype=pound">$31,900</a> a year for life to appear magically in my bank account, in all of our bank accounts, like Mary Seton, I would not be bitter, I would not be concerned. But because it isn’t going to, I am bitter, I am concerned. I must be – we must be.</p>

<p>The fourth Thursday in November is my favorite yearly holiday, because it celebrates everyday pleasures: time off, food, and friends. The “holidays” are often nice in this regard, but the commercial slant that the Christmas season takes wearies me even before November ends.

<p>There has been a lot of discussion about poverty lately, as part of the increasing attention to the phenomenon of widening income disparity. Recently, the Census Bureau <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/us/poverty-gets-new-measure-at-census-bureau.html" target="_blank">revised the way it calculates poverty rates</a>, including for the first time costs such as taxes, child care, and medical expenses, as well as accounting for non-cash benefits like food-stamps and the earned income tax credit. By this measure, there are fewer households with children below the poverty line, but more people in the category of the ‘near poor,’ who don’t qualify for benefits.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/19/us/census-measures-those-not-quite-in-poverty-but-struggling.html?pagewanted=2" target="_blank">Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation </a>objects to the use of the term ‘near poverty’ on the grounds that it conjures images of material want that are misleading, preferring the term ‘low-income.’ The rub that Rector would like to ignore with this neutral term is that you don’t have be starving and homeless to struggle with not earning enough money to comfortably cover your bills (let alone save). Indeed, the near poor are in a different but equally difficult dilemma of trying to hang on to the little more (than the poor) they’ve got. As anyone who has experienced it, living paycheck to paycheck – where one unexpected expense (medical bill, car trouble) is enough to knock you off-balance – <em>is</em> a hardship. This remains true even if (like half of the near poor) you are married and own your own home. Twenty-eight percent of the near poor work <em>fulltime</em>.</p>
<h3>The Way</h3>
<p><em>The Way</em>, <a href="http://www.iconmovies.co.uk/theway/" target="_blank">a new film by Emilio Estevez</a>, stars the inimitable Martin Sheen, although the true protagonist of the movie is indeed the route from which it takes its title: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_of_St._James" target="_blank">The Way of St. James</a>, or, in Spanish, El Camino de Santiago. This 1000-year old pilgrimage route – said to retrace the journey traveled by St. James’ remains to his final resting place in the cathedral built for them in Santiago de Compostela – is commonly begun in the French Pyrenees, making for a journey of around 800km (~500mi).</p>

<p>Martin Sheen plays Thomas Avery, whose son Daniel has recently abandoned his pursuit of a PhD in Anthropology. While playing golf, Tom receives word that his son has died in a weather-related accident in France, having just set out to make the pilgrimage (on foot, as is traditional) to Santiago de Compostela. Tom travels to Roncesvalles to pick up the body, but while there he decides to cremate the body and make the pilgrimage with the ashes. In his hasty decision – made possible only by the fact that he has all of the supplies carried by his son – Tom becomes a very unlikely sort of pilgrim, in that his decision is spontaneous and his motivations entirely unrelated to any notion of progress.</p>

<p>As might be expected in a contemporary experience of pilgrimage, the three other pilgrims he collects (rather reluctantly) as traveling companions all have motives related to self-improvement. Joost, an outgoing, charming Dutchman with a soft spot for fine food and wine, is trying to lose weight in time for his brother’s wedding; Sarah, an embittered Canadian divorcee, is trying to quit smoking; Jack, an Irish travel writer, is trying to overcome his writer’s block. Until they all know why Tom is there, they are perplexed by his terse, almost angry manner, which runs contrary to the friendliness that is the hallmark of the non-penitential self-help ethos of the new millennium.</p>

<p>Along the way, the four often turn to a discussion of the pilgrimage itself, and what makes for a genuine pilgrimage, and a true pilgrim: do true pilgrims use bikes? stay in fine hotels? listen to iPods? carry Blackberrys? use credit cards? In a moment of angry grief, Tom ironically proposes his son as the truest pilgrim, for he has given his life along the way. Later, the four watch three monks pass by: two self-flagellating and the third carrying a huge wooden cross. Is any pilgrim truer than another?</p>

<p>The film is beautiful: gorgeous scenery, excellent music, and thoughtful pacing (including an unexpected subplot involving the Roma). For an inevitably spiritual subject matter, it is an unbelievably down-to-earth film – imagine, if you can, the complete opposite of <em><a title="On swatting fliesâ€¦ and butterflies" href="http://www.lightthetunnel.net/?p=87">The Tree of Life</a></em>. I don’t make this comparison randomly; I make it because the <em>Tree of Life</em> is also a spiritual film about grief. Indeed, by the end of the <em>The Way</em>, we learn that all three of Tom’s new friends are in fact making the pilgrimage in order to come to terms with a loss. (Warning: spoiler alert!) Joost, who predictably gains rather than loses weight during the trip, hides behind his joviality his devastation of his wife’s refusal to sleep with him since he’s gained weight; Sarah is mourning the abortion she had to save the child from her abusive ex-husband; even Jack, who is inspired by Tom’s journey to start writing again, is trying to come to terms with the novelist he never became.</p>

<p>And perhaps it is their new understanding of their own grief that finally compels the three to continue with Tom to the sea, where he scatters the remainder of his son’s ashes. Joost no thinner, but happily resigned to buy a new suit for the wedding; Sara still lighting up, acknowledging at last that the journey was never about quitting cigarettes; Jack reconciled to the less-glamorous writerly life–the one that, he now realizes, he has chosen.</p>

<p>And Tom? Well, he just keeps going. There’s progress for you.</p>

<p>At first I was delighted that Herman Cain’s serial sexual harassment of women took a toll on his popularity. But as Newt Gingrich supplanted him as the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, my delight turned back to dismay. Not that I thought Cain’s workplace misdeeds disqualified him to be President.

<p>I actually watched the hour of the debate on November 12 that was televised on CBS. And the only candidate that seemed even remotely humble, reasonable, and knowledgeable enough to belong on that stage is Jon Huntsman, whom most people probably haven’t even heard of. The other major candidates could have been bested by prep-school debaters, in terms of polish, directness, and knowledge of the subject matter.</p>

<p>We are in a new era of overreach, in which people believe in their own competence too readily and assert their own adequacy too fervently. Michelle Bachman’s tragic flaw of believing the idiotic things she hears (e.g., the woman who told her the HPV vaccine can cause mental retardation) is not a simple gullibility—it is an unfortunate side effect of having imbibed her own Kool-Aid: she believes everything she thinks.</p>

<p>Herman Cain, on the other hand, is a straight-up case of self-promoting puffery. Nobody but Fox was paying attention at this point, but in his announcement of his candidacy, he compared his reaching the White House to the achievement of civil rights, quoting—and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoBH8a_HgyM">this you really have to see to believe</a>—Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

<p>Unlike Ms. Bialek, I don’t want Herman Cain to come clean about his misconduct and move forward. I want him to get back onto the motivational-book-tour bus he rode in on and disappear into an endorsement sunset. He can call Sarah Palin and talk talk show possibilities. While I don’t excuse sexual misconduct, I don’t believe that one’s moral conduct is correlated to one’s professional skills. While Bill Clinton clearly had his share of peccadillos (some welcomed by women, others perhaps less so), he also was an intelligent, experienced, and credible politician, and an above-average President. Sure he overreached, but at least he didn’t underwhelm.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-see-something-say-something">“If you see something, say something”</h3>
<p>The other day, I was driving home from the grocery store and I was waiting for a left-arrow light, and the car in front of me, driven by an older lady, had the gas tank door open and the lid off. It was one of those lids that’s kept connected to the car by a plastic ring, so you can’t lose it. Still, it’s not good to be driving like that. And so I’m stopped behind her and the light is red, and I’m thinking “What do I do?” Do I honk and try to indicate the problem? Do I jump out and try to get her attention, or just go over and fix it, and hope I don’t startle her, or startle myself by trying to put the lid on a gas tank of a car that could start moving again at any moment? Do I do nothing and trust it’ll be okay, figuring that the driver or someone else will—eventually—notice the problem?</p>

<p>Granted, seeing a car with a dangling gas cap is not like seeing a young boy being raped in the shower, but this little incident did give me a tiny glimpse into the deciding mind. It is easy enough to know when we see something that is amiss, and because we are so good at discernment, it is easy to mistake this ability for the separate skill of responding, of acting based on the information we have received.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/opinion/brooks-lets-all-feel-superior.html">David Brooks points out</a>, it is pretty easy to imagine ourselves making a better choice when we witness what we appear to be someone’s failing. But while he would chalk it up to our inflated sense of “inner wonderfulness”—the result of decades of pop-psych pump-up of the American ego—I think that the reverse phenomenon is partially to blame. In contrast to the display of arrogance and ignorance that is the pack of Republican presidential candidates, I think that many times when we do not act when we see something wrong, it is not because we doubt its wrongness, but because we doubt the effectiveness of our response. What if we make the situation worse, not only for the person we intend to help, but also for ourselves? This is not merely a craven fear of the pusillanimous, but rather an extension of a natural and indeed healthy self-doubt, a recognition of our limitations to change the course of events set in motion and often abetted by others in positions of authority.</p>

<p>Whatever our own hesitations to cry foul, we are certainly quick to express our outrage at the overreach of a pedophile: we promptly dismiss him as abnormal, suffering from a sickness, a perversion. But the disgusting overreach of the pedophile is just the other side of the coin of the gilded overreach we foster in those we put on pedestals. Perhaps Joe Paterno once had a reasonable opinion of himself. Clearly at some point, though, he started to drink the Kool-Aid manufactured by the denizens of Happy Valley, becoming the heroic and infallible JoePa they so much wanted him to be. He believed in his benevolent reign so much so that when Mike McQueary told him about an unmistakable act of abuse at the very heart of his realm, his response was to ask Jerry Sandusky not to bring children into the locker room—as if an immoral act, once removed from his fiefdom, would simply cease to exist.</p>

<h3 id="supercommittee-epic-fail">Supercommittee, Epic Fail</h3>
<p>I wish someone could explain to me why the Republicans are so opposed to raising taxes to deal with the national debt. I get the whole “starve the beast” tactic—force government to downsize by denying it revenue—but if one is so concerned about the debt, shouldn’t one propose tax increases precisely to pay it off? This leads me to think rather cynically about the Grover Norquist tax pledge—it’s not just an ideological <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/opinion/brooks-the-two-moons.html">chastity belt, as David Brooks suggested</a>, but a lock rich people want to put on their own wallets.</p>

<p>If the Republicans believe that government should be smaller, then they should say so. They should feel free to argue that we should spend less because they don’t believe in paying for government agencies whose names they can’t remember (I mean you, Rick Perry) and because they’d prefer not to pay for medical care and give out pensions (aka Social Security). Except, of course, when it comes to their health insurance and their pensions.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the cases challenging <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=131544">the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate</a> that everyone purchase health insurance. The plaintiffs assert that you cannot force someone to engage in comercial activity, as if to demand that everyone participate in order to make the system work for the benefit of all is some sort of anti-democratic overreach. And yet this is a country whose history is marked by desperate struggles for the the right to participate: the Civil War, the Suffragettes, the civil rights movement, the push for marriage equality.</p>

<p>Overreach is precisely what people accused Franklin D. Roosevelt of when he proposed Social Security, unemployment insurance, and the various programs of the New Deal. But if you are not a believer in government being an active force in society, why are you in government at all? Just to stop the madness? How is it exactly that someone can seek to be part of the government on the principle that they should be paid to participate in something they feel is overgrown and wasteful? And how is it that people can continue to vote for these folks? “Vote for me—I will make sure the government gets smaller and spends less of your money!” Less of my money on whom? Not on you, I’m guessing.</p>

<p>If someone really believed government was wasteful, he would distance himself from it, not get on the payroll to rant and rave about how wasteful it is. Or, if he must get involved, why doesn’t he agree to work for free, save the suffering taxpayers some cash? Or agree to buy his health insurance out-of-pocket, instead of letting the government pick up the tab? Or decline his pension? But no. They are collecting their paychecks, accruing their pensions, and ranting about the debt. And meanwhile, they are not doing anything to alleviate the joblessness, increasing poverty, and growing income inequality in America.</p>

<p>It is a syllogism of the most cynical kind to claim that the debt prevents the government from giving jobs to Americans who want to earn a living and contribute to society. The debt, as the Eurozone crisis has demonstrated, is a problem, and it must be faced. But frankly, what stops us from putting Americans to work is merely our lack of willingness to do so. For a capitalist, buying labor-power only makes sense when this labor-power can create surplus value. People, however, still need the means to procure food, shelter, clothing, and care. If we don’t believe in granting these means based on the simple principle of life meriting sustenance, then work—considered the normative means to meet these needs—must be granted the status of a human right.</p>

<p>This is what FDR understood when he designed the New Deal. He understood that people intrinsically had something to offer, whether they were masons or musicians, engineers or engine repairmen. And he created the opportunities for these people to offer their services, their talent, their labor, simply because they were there and they needed this opportunity.</p>

<p>If this rhetoric now falls on mostly deaf ears, if it sounds socialist or communist or anti-democratic, we would do well to consider whether the empty-headed overreach of each successive front-runner for the GOP nomination sounds any better. It certainly doesn’t to me.</p>

<p>Today, Mississippians are voting on the above amendment to their state constitution. This amendment, which is promoted by its supporters as a way to outlaw abortion and cloning within Mississippi, also carries the potential to cloud many other issues, including the use of birth control methods that function by preventing uterine implantation and the handling of embryos during infertility treatments.</p>

<p>No matter how you feel about the abortion issue, it should be noted that being “pro-life” cannot be readily grafted onto the legal concept of personhood. An awareness of the potential complications, given the numerous mentions of ‘person’ in the state constitution, motivated the Catholic Diocese of Jackson, Miss. <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/mississippi-prepares-to-vote-on-personhood-amendment/">not to take a position on the amendment</a>, despite its support for a definition of human life at conception. The space between a religious understanding of life and a legal understanding of personhood is easily illustrated by the misfortune of miscarriage, which the Church would certainly not view as related to abortion, but which the Mississippi amendment could potentially reframe as manslaughter. While already 38 of the 50 states have fetal homicide laws—intending to protect mother and unborn child from attacks by third parties—there is a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges">growing trend to use these laws to prosecute mothers</a> in cases of miscarriage and stillbirths.</p>

<p>The Mississippi amendment is no doubt partly motivated by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges">the case of Rennie Gibbs</a>, who became pregnant at 15 and whose child was stillborn at 36 weeks. Once it was discovered that Ms. Gibbs was a cocaine user, she was charged with “depraved-heart murder” of her child, a crime that carries a mandatory life sentence. Defense lawyers, however, pointed out that according to Mississippi law, even if Ms. Gibbs had intended to harm her fetus, she couldn’t be prosecuted, as <em>it was not illegal for a mother to try to cause an abortion</em>. (It is illegal, however, for a third party to attempt to cause an (unwanted) abortion.) As repugnant as this may sound to many ears, it would be rather non-sensical from a legal point of view if it were licit for a woman to seek an abortion but not to perform one on herself. Amendment 26 would of course change this, for it would give the mother and fetus equivalent legal standing.</p>

<p>While I remain pro-choice, I remain so on legal grounds rather than philosophical ones. Philosophically, I don’t need to be convinced that life starts at conception—for a woman intending to have a baby, there is no doubt that she understands what is inside her as life as soon as the tests confirm she is pregnant. Indeed, this appreciation is often pushed back even further in time for women who become pregnant from artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization—how could they not understand their child’s life as beginning at that moment?</p>

<p>In the case of an unwanted pregnancy, however, a woman’s attitude may change. The question thus arises: but if it is a life when you do want it, how can it not be a life when you don’t want it? This is the uncomfortable fact at the root of the abortion debate. The pro-life camp might say “that life has a right to live;” the pro-choice camp might say “a woman has a right to control her own body”. Neither of these arguments, I would suggest, get at the root of the issue, as both sacrifice principles to practice. In reality, neither that unborn life nor that living body is truly independent in the ways that these two sides of the debate would suggest. On the one hand, the fetus lives literally inside the mother, and thus its right to life cannot be considered separate of her; on the other, the woman’s body itself is contingent on a wealth of internal and external factors out of anyone’s control. Within this material world, there is no such thing as <em>an idea of life</em>, there is only its manifestation.</p>

  <p>Slavery is the legal fiction that a person is property. Corporate personhood is the legal fiction that property is a person. —Jan Edwards and Molly Morgan, <a href="http://www.greens.org/s-r/35/35-19.html">Abolish Corporate Personhood</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="space">Space</h3>
<p>The Occupy Movement has, among other things, stirred up a fair amount of anti-corporation sentiment. For many people on the left, the source of the problematic power possessed by corporations lies in the fact that they constitute legal “persons,” and are thus entitled to many constitutional protections extended to actual people.</p>

<p>Strangely, the coming-into-personhood of the corporation is related to the ending of the institution of slavery in America, for it was the Supreme Court’s extension of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to corporations that allowed them to assume the rights of personhood. Stranger still, the Court <a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=43811311612&amp;topic=12012">never really decided this issue</a> so much as took it for granted that the amendment applied to corporations; the Chief Justice simply stated the Court’s belief in an unrelated remark during the oral arguments of <em>Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad</em>, 118 U.S. 394 (1886), a case that was unrelated to the notion of corporate personhood.</p>

<p>Yet the assumption was far-reaching, as the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment—meant originally to protect freed slaves!—allowed them to escape regulation and grow powerful. “Between 1890 and 1910,” Joel Bakan notes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corporation-Pathological-Pursuit-Profit-Power/dp/0743247469/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320767240&amp;sr=1-1">The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power</a> “business interests invoked the Fourteenth Amendment 288 times before the courts, compared to 19 times by African Americans, according to Mary Zepernick of the Program on Corporations, Law and Democracy in an interview” (172).</p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>While corporations are subject to greater regulation now than in the hey-day of the robber barons (FDR’s threat to pack the court in 1937 convinced the justices not to block his New Deal), corporations’ status as persons still gives them disproportional power. The controversial <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/"><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em></a> decision, in which the Supreme Court held that political spending is a form of protected speech, now allows corporations (and other groups, such as unions) to spend unlimited money in support of political issues and candidates.</p>

<p>In this context, free means unfettered, but it would be hard to believe that this type of “free speech,” i.e., corporations “speaking” through money, is supportive of a healthy democracy, in which context this fundamental right is usually invoked. This evolution toward a cynical interpretation of the Constitution seems to result in a kind of rhetorical malaise, in which politicians can grind out the same ol’ wonderful phrases of “an American Century” and exhort us to “believe in America,” as Mitt Romney put it in his <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/10/07/text-of-mitt-romneys-speech-on-foreign-policy-at-the-citadel/">foreign policy speech</a> delivered at the Citadel in South Carolina on 7 October 2011, without capturing the heart or imagination of the American electorate.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65857.html">Romney’s Mormonism</a> may explain some of the difficulty he has had gaining popular support for his presidential bid—despite the tacit assumption that, as the establishment candidate, he’ll surely get the nod—I would suggest that the obvious strain of such Reagan-era rhetoric also contributes to his lack of appeal. While it has become patriotic in certain circles to aspire to defend “liberty” in the form of deregulation and “the pursuit of happiness” in the form of lower taxes, these empty promises of prosperity seems less and less correlated to reality. So we take refuge in the fundamental goodness and innocence of “life” in the form of an embryo, and go vote to give full legal rights to the unborn as the poverty rate (among the already-born) rises and millions of (already-grown) Americans are unemployed.</p>

<p>We seem unable to grapple with the unprincipled problems of children in poverty, jobs exported overseas, and healthcare costs rising as surely as the earth’s oceans. Romney is reasonably qualified to be president – he certainly made some positive changes in Massachusetts as Governor, despite now decrying “Obamacare”. Listening to Romney remark that “corporations are people” in reply to hecklers at the Iowa State Fair (watch the clip as part of <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/394519/august-11-2011/romney-2012----corporations-are-people-">Steven Colbert’s brilliant send-up of it</a>), you get the impression that the rhetoric has gone to his head, that he actually has more faith in the purity of clichés than in the fact that he helped bring about near-universal healthcare coverage in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>While I have no doubt that Herman Cain has no capacity, and even less genuine desire, to take on these issues as President, I can see why he is so amusing as a candidate. Even though I can see right through Cain’s faux-populism (can you imagine paying a 9% federal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States#Summary_table">sales tax on <em>food</em></a>?), I can’t bear to hear Romney’s platitudes. Uninformed and pompous as he is, Herman Cain is more believable as a person than the clean-cut capitalist; even if he is a pants-on-fire liar about 9-9-9 being fair, at least his claims are not the same ones that have been repeated <em>ad nauseam</em>—and proven ridiculous—by a long line of suits.</p>

<p>So what if he’s a serial sexual harasser of women? Everyone knows that some embryos grow up to be jerks.</p>

<p>With the chill of fall suddenly in the air, the prospect of a cold snap interrupting the settlement in Zuccotti Park becomes a reasonable subject of speculation. Not that miserable weather couldn’t be overcome by the resolve and the resourcefulness that have been repeatedly demonstrated by the occupiers in New York’s financial district; between donations of gloves and Gor-tex, and smart rotations of sleeping in the park, the occupation could very likely continue into the winter. In any case, even if it were to end tomorrow, it has lasted long enough to garner mainstream media attention and an (at least temporary) place in our collective social recall.</p>

<p>The call from many quarters for the movement to formulate a more consistent message seem to reflect a naivety about the nature of protest in this Great Recession era. The Freedom Riders’ (see this <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/">stunning American Experience episode</a>) very act of appearing was an act of protest, because the way they appeared – in an integrated group traveling by bus across state lines – was considered a crime. They embodied their demand; they were demanding the right to do what they were doing, and they did so at incredible risk to themselves. Though in a different context, the protests against the Vietnam war also represented a body-based claim; they showed up in order to protest the killing of young American men in an overseas conflict. While segregation and war are undoubtedly political issues, I perceive the resistance movements these travesties spawned as fundamentally different from what is interpreted today as political protest.</p>

<p>In a recent column, <em>New York Times</em> columnist Nicholas Kristof proposes we “[Occupy the Classroom](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/opinion/occupy-the-classroom.html], by which he means expanding early childhood education.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>… the question isn’t whether we can afford early childhood education, but whether we can afford not to provide it. We can pay for prisons or we can pay, less, for early childhood education to help build a fairer and more equitable nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While of course Kristof is right that early childhood education is valuable, benefitting both the child and society overall, the idea that unequal opportunity – in the sense of realizing one’s individual potential through education – is responsible for the economic situation we find ourselves in at this moment is downright risible. Although it is true that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/opinion/sunday/social-inequality-and-the-new-elite.html?pagewanted=2">an increasing number of students at the nation’s top colleges are children of upper- or upper-middle class parents</a>, there are plenty of middle-class students who have earned a bachelor’s degree – often incurring surreal amounts of loan debt in the process – who cannot find work. The lack of opportunity here is not merely, or even mainly, in the arena of education, but within that of employment. (I mean, do you need a B. A. to work at Target?) Americans are addicted to the notion (myth?) of self-betterment as the main ingredient in upward mobility, but in fact our history proves that while we remain committed to the principle of inclusion (i.e., equality of opportunity for all), we are not so motivated to reengineer the resulting wealth disparities (i.e., equality of condition). Indeed, despite the economic crisis, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/opinion/sunday/social-inequality-and-the-new-elite.html?">wealth redistribution is still largely viewed as quintessentially un-American</a>.</p>

<p>The inspiring part of Occupy Wall Street, for me, is its constructive embrace of futility. The protesters are neither desperate nor naive enough to think that their presence is going to bring down the financial system as we know it, or lead to massive, wealth-redistributing economic reforms. (Indeed, the only reforms it seems to be sparking are those related to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/opinion/zuccotti-park-and-the-private-plaza-problem.html?">regulation of privately-owned public spaces in New York City</a>. In the yawning chasm of this intermission in the American Dream, they are building a meaningful meantime, a hands-on, face-to-face alternative to the virtual friending and self-promoting ahead-getting that has become the status quo among millennials. Outside of the rip current of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, they are meeting one another on the other, more personal, and more uncertain side of the accomplishment-equals-success equation.</p>

<p>Americans, who for better or worse, tend to define themselves by their jobs (especially by the fact that they are hard-working), are discovering in bigger numbers than in (almost) living memory what it means to live a full life that does not include regular (or sufficient, or gainful) employment. Until the first condition – that of predictable employment – is removed, no one thinks much of all the assumptions and practices that follow it, like obedient dominos toppling in mesmerizing, patriotic solidarity. There is a great incentive to mind one’s own business, tired after a long week at the office, ready and able to indulge the family in a dinner and movie (the former delivered to the door, the latter to the TV). The naturalness of the nuclear family is confirmed as its continuance is perpetuated by the bi-weekly direct deposit of the paycheck. All is well in the (first) world.</p>

<p>Occupy Wall Street proves that different social structures are not just imaginable, but actually readily deployable. Anyone with an Internet connection can order Liberty Park’s denizens-du-jour a pizza (including, from nearby <a href="http://www.liberatospizza.com/Welcome.tpl&quot;">Liberatos Pizza</a> an OccuPie – a cheese pizza with a strip of pepperoni across the middle, mimicking the ‘no’ symbol). Donations of clothes, materials, and cash have more or less spontaneously flowed. Granted, most of the people sleeping in the park have nearby homes to retreat to when the dirt and discomfort overwhelm, but to measure a movement’s sincerity by a misguided standard of purity is to miss the entire point. OWS is not about helping the needy or proving a point through sleeping in the cold, but rather about showing up in a space that is neither home, nor school, nor work – a space that has largely slipped the minds of most Americans, but one that will rise in importance as more as more Americans find themselves in it.</p>

<h3 id="exchange">Exchange</h3>
<p>For many, the term ‘occupation’ cannot help bring to mind the long-standing conflict in the Middle East, symbolized by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories">Occupied Palestinian Territories</a>—that is the term used by the United Nations (and other international legal bodies) to refer to the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip. Although peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are stalled, recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/world/middleeast/israel-and-palestinians-begin-prisoner-exchange.html?">a prisoner exchange made the news</a>.</p>

<p>On 18 October 2011, in a deal brokered in part by Egypt, Hamas released a 25-year old Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit (who had been captured in 2006 in the Gaza Strip by Palestinian militants) in exchange for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. While the return of Shalit represents a rare moment of joy – he is the first captured Israeli soldier returned alive in 26 years – it is also a cause for concern, as it is feared that the released prisoners will resume the activities against Israel that prompted their initial imprisonment.</p>

<p>This moment of optimism for the families whose loved ones are being returned is underscored by the larger sense of futility in this conflict. The desire for “another Gilad Shalit” expressed by many during rallies in the West Bank and Gaza (in the hopes that similar exchanges could lead to the return of the remaining 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails) seems only to reinforce the idea that, despite the obvious effectiveness of negotiation, it is only conceivable as part of a conflict strategy. The possibility of peace seems simultaneously genuine and unrealistic, the ready practicalities of compromise overshadowed and overwhelmed by uncompromising principles.</p>

<h3 id="busy-signal">Busy Signal</h3>
<p>Farm work is hard, and in Alabama these days there is a shortage of people willing and able to do it. This is the result of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/us/alabama-immigration-law-upheld.html">new law aimed at reducing the number of illegal immigrants in the state</a>. The law, which took effect at the beginning of October, creates more penalties for people and companies who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, nullifies contracts entered into by illegal immigrants, forbids contracts between illegal immigrants and state agencies (such as those for water and sewage service), and requires law enforcement officials to try to verify the immigration status of a person during a routine traffic stop or arrest, if there is “reasonable suspicion” that the person is not here legally. Furthermore, although it is against federal law to deny public schooling to children, regardless of their immigration status, the new law requires primary and secondary schools in Alabama to determine students’ status upon enrollment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/opinion/its-what-they-asked-for.html?">The law has had immediate and substantial effects</a>: Hispanics are disappearing from jobs, homes, and, the case of children, schools. Farmers are up-in-arms, having lost a workforce that they cannot easily—if at all—replace in time for fall’s harvest and plantings. While it is convenient to take the attitude—as many in Alabama do—that people who are breaking the law should now run out of fear, the fear is not limited to the undocumented. After all, many families are of mixed immigration status, and even if you are legal, the climate the law has produced cannot be very reassuring. If you were walking down the street or driving in your car on a regular day, could you prove your citizenship or demonstrate your legal presence in this country? I don’t even have a copy of my birth certificate handy, and I only carry my passport when I’m headed for foreign shores.</p>

<p>The fact is, the most law-abiding citizen among us relies upon and benefits from the work that illegal immigrants do in this country. They not only keep food coming in from the fields, they make sure that the prices we pay for it are low. The idea that if we got rid of illegal immigrants, everyone in this country who wanted one would have a job is so simplistic as to be laughable – the federal government already operates a migrant worker program precisely because there aren’t enough Americans who will work in the fields. And just this morning I heard <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/24/141638999/labor-worries-rise-as-planting-season-nears-in-ala">a farmer in Alabama freely admit on the radio</a>that he preferred not to hire workers through the program, which mandates higher wages and requires that the farmer provide housing “approved by the government.” I hate to spoil the party line, but for some folks, being against government intervention means being in favor of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Did you notice that Mitt Romney, in the recent Republican Presidential Candidates debate, when accused of having “illegals” (Rick Perry’s slur-like term, at least to my ear) working on his property as part of the landscape service he used, didn’t even address the overall issue of undocumented workers, but focused only on the cosmetic problem of a politician being caught touching, to to speak, this sore spot? Basically, to paraphrase, he said/implied: “Why would I knowingly hire illegal immigrants when I know that it is going to be used against me to make me look bad? What, do you think I’m stupid?” Rick Perry accused Romney of hypocrisy on this issue, but the hypocrite here is actually Perry: everyone, including Perry, knows that illegal immigrants live and work in this country – heck, Perry himself passed a state law in Texas allowing them to pay in-state college tuition! While politicians are known to be more careful about keeping up appearances when it comes to their personal employment practices, such care is often not out of morality or patriotism, but political self-preservation.</p>

<p>We all know that there is work for illegal immigrants in this country, either because Americans aren’t willing to do those jobs, or because employers aren’t willing to pay the money that Americans would like – or, as is sadly the case, that minimum-wage laws mandate. But instead of admitting these facts and trying to change the system that has begat them, we demonize and even dehumanize people who risk their lives to enter this country from points south in order to fill these jobs. Do you think Herman Cain was joking, as he later claimed, when he said he would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/us/politics/bachmann-and-cain-deliver-blistering-attacks-on-illegal-immigration.html?">build a fence (along the border with Mexico) that could kill would-be immigrants by electrocution</a>? Do you think that Michele Bachman wants to build a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/us/politics/bachmann-and-cain-deliver-blistering-attacks-on-illegal-immigration.html?">“secure double fence” and make the government’s official language English</a> because she is fearful of marauding Canadians with accents, or, heaven forfend, the knowledge of French? You can dress up immigration concerns all you like in economic rationales, but these recent comments certainly leave a racist, xenophobic taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>Sometime within this decade, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/us/06census.html?ref=census">the majority of people under 18 in this country will no longer be white</a>.

If the GOP wants to get elected, it needs to get real: instead of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/us/politics/immigration-talk-turns-off-some-hispanics.html?">alienating Hispanic voters</a>, it should be courting them.</p>

<p>It’s time to get out of this occupation mentality, and get busy treating people as people, and problems as problems. No one benefits when we get the two confused.</p>

<h3 id="sex-with-the-sun-goddess">Sex with the Sun Goddess</h3>
<p>I was listening to Fresh Air the other day, and Terri Gross was interviewing C. Peter Wagner, the namer of and prominent figure in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/03/140946482/apostolic-leader-weighs-religions-role-in-politics">new charismatic Christian movement that seeks to take dominion over politics, business and culture in preparation for the end times and Jesus’ return</a>. The members of this movement espouse some ideas that range from the traditional (from a religious right point of view) to the downright bizarre. Wagner, who came across as a down-to-earth religious elder type, a person more interested in spreading the Gospel than spreading hate, is nonetheless perhaps best known for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIgZPTqUIc">viral video</a> in which he argues that Japan’s Shinto-dominated culture is responsible for its longterm economic woes—as well as its recent climatic ones.</p>

<p>Specifically, the origin of the difficulties is in a ceremony in which the emperor, according to Wagner, has sex with the sun goddess in a ceremony called <em>diajo-sai</em>. Here is a description of the final part of the ceremony, as <a href="&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthronement_of_the_Japanese_Emperor#The_Daijo-sai">as described on Wikipedia</a>. Amaterasu is the Sun Goddess.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kneeling on a mat situated to face the Grand Shrine of Ise, the emperor makes an offering of the sacred rice, the sake made from this rice, millet, fish and a variety of other foods from both the land and the sea, to Amaterasu. Then he eats some of this sacred rice himself, as an act of divine communion which consummates his singular unity with Amaterasu, thus making him (in Shinto tradition) the intermediary between Amaterasu and the Japanese people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m no Shinto scholar, but this element of the enthronement ceremony of the Japanese emperor seems more rooted in agrarian-based traditions that emphasize connection to the harvest and communion with the land’s fertility. Indeed, <em>daijo-sai</em> means Great Thanksgiving Festival. To sensationalize this practice as “sex” seems as limiting as labeling the Christian Eucharist (also known as communion) a form of cannibalism.</p>

<p>Sex-sationalism aside, Wagner’s ultimate point is theological, namely, that all gods that are not God are forces of evil, or Satan. (Indeed, perhaps the mention of sex is a convenient and catchy shorthand for evil.) From the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sun goddess is not a very nice lady. The sun goddess is a power of darkness, which is headed up by the kingdom of Satan. And so the sun goddess wants natural disasters to come to Japan. Sometimes the hand of God, which is more powerful, will prevent them. And when he decides to prevent them and when he doesn’t is far beyond anything that we can predict.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in this case, God could have prevented that tsunami and the destruction, but he didn’t. He just took his hand off and allowed these natural forces to work. And one of the background pieces of information is Japan is under control of the sun goddess.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with cause-and-effect claims regarding evil and disaster; <a href="http://www.actupny.org/YELL/falwell.html">Jerry Falwell blamed everyone he dislikes</a> (pagans, feminists, abortionists, homosexuals) for the terrorist attacks of 9/11. What interests me here isn’t the hatred angle, since, as I said, Wagner convincingly (to me, anyway) represented himself as a man who, while he doesn’t believe that “homosexuality is God’s Plan A,” is far more interested in sharing the Gospel as a source of betterment, both for individuals and for the world at large. While the promotion of the evangelical platform as the only and/or best way to do this strikes me as naive, I can’t say I am outraged by the goal of greater peace and plenty for a greater number of human beings. Indeed, far from outraged by it, I share it.</p>

<p>What strikes me instead is Wagner’s view of nature, specifically the concept of contingency with regard to it. For him, God’s will is a constant work-in-progress—he created the earth and the heavens, but this was just the groundwork, as he also creates the weather on a day-to-day basis. On those grounds, God himself causes earthquakes and tsunamis, or doesn’t. Moreover, these “choices” are contingent on something other than mere caprice.
Let’s contrast this with some eloquent words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At times other forces cause us to question the ableness of God. The stark and colossal reality of evil in the world—what Keats calls “the giant agony of the world”; ruthless floods and tornadoes that wipe away people as though they were weeds in an open field; ills like insanity plaguing some individuals from birth and reducing their days to tragic cycles of meaninglessness; the madness of war and the barbarity of man’s inhumanity to man—why, we ask, do these things occur if God is able to prevent them? This problem, the problem of evil, has always plagued the mind of man. I would limit my response to an assertion that much of the evil we experience is caused by man’s folly and ignorance and also by the misuse of his freedom. Beyond this, I can say only that there is and always will be a penumbra of mystery surrounding God. What appears at the moment to be evil may have a purpose that our finite minds are incapable of comprehending. So in spite of the presence of evil and the doubts that lurk in our minds, we shall wish not to surrender the conviction that our God is able. (110-111)</p>
  <h4 id="our-god-is-able-the-strength-to-love">—”Our God is Able” (<em>The Strength to Love</em>)</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>God’s will is too expansive, and therefore too mysterious, to be conceived of by the human mind. King does not deny evil here, or man’s ability to do evil, but he does rule out a simplistic relationship between our actions and what we perceive as God’s restraint from acting against evil—or what we perceive as evil. Elsewhere, he also draws a distinction between God and nature, the latter which “must honor ever-lastingly her fixed, immutable laws. When these laws are violated, she has no alternative except to follow inexorably her path of uniformity. Nature does not and cannot forgive.” (“Love in Action,” <em>The Strength to Love</em>, p. 34) In this way, a man who falls from a tall building cannot be understood as either willed by God to keep falling toward the earth or not prevented by God from doing so. The relationship between God and nature is not as simplistic as the latter being an ever-mutable expression of the former’s contingent will. In short, one shouldn’t take gravity—or tsunamis—personally.</p>

<h3 id="the-expanding-universe">The Expanding Universe</h3>
<p>Last week, Saul Perlmutter (UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Adam Riess (Johns Hopkins University) and Brian Schmidt (Australian National University) <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-sci-nobel-expanding-universe-20111005,0,3011276.story">were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics</a> for their discovery that the universe is expanding at an increasing rate, rather than a decreasing rate, as had been previously assumed. Riess was on the team led by Schmidt; Perlmutter and his team came to the same conclusion independently.</p>

<p>While working on a post-doc in 1997, Riess initially thought the results of his calculations on the distance of tell-tale Type 1a supernovae were incorrect. The theory at the time was that the force of gravity had been gradually slowing the expansion of the universe—an expansion initiated at the moment in time called the Big Bang—and that eventually, gravity would lead to a subsequent contraction of the universe, called the Big Crunch. The experiments in which Riess was participating were designed to measure the rate of this deceleration.</p>

<p>In a total revision of that theory, the Nobelists posit the existence of “dark energy” as the force responsible for an increasing rate of expansion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The two teams proposed that the acceleration could be explained by the repulsive force of dark energy, which is now estimated to make up 73% of the universe. (Dark matter, which is unrelated to dark energy, makes up 23% of the universe, and all visible matter a mere 4%.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leaves me wondering if the theory of the Big Crunch still applies—even though I know I won’t be around for it, I prefer the idea of endless expansion, endless entropy, to a cosmic calling-in of all celestial bodies, both light and dark, matter and anti-matter.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is a bit cavalier to express philosophical preferences about matters that are treated as weighty scientific truths—or equally seriously dismissed as deluded apostasy. What the scientists and the creationists—and the creationist scientists, too—have in common is that it interests them how the universe began, it matters to them. In my mind, whether this interest takes the form of wanting to teach the Bible in a science course or studying the distant stars, it is the same interest, the same compelling pull of the forces of light and dark, albeit differently understood. And so is the belief that, with enough faith or enough research, respectively, we can know the origin of things.</p>

<p>I’m not a doubter, per se, of either the Bible or of Science. I find the idea of teaching “creationism” in schools as part of a science curriculum preposterous and indeed insulting—to the Bible. Whether received as sacred word or as literary/historical text, it doesn’t seem to me to be asking to be part of Science, about which I think it could frankly care less. Science is a different kind of Truth, based on different assumptions and different experiences; while that appears to upset certain people, it doesn’t upset the Bible.</p>

<p>At the end of a gorgeous fall day, it occurs to me that the creation of the world in six days and the redshift of supernova revealing an acceleration in the expansion rate of the universe are both narratives, and they matter far more as narratives than as anything else. I have no doubt that the former will continue to be read and pondered, the latter researched and revised. And the sun will continue to rise and set, at least for now.</p>

<p>I have faith and I have curiosity. But I also know I feel differently day to day, month to month, year to year. I don’t believe everything I think, as much as I enjoy thinking. And I can’t make a spider’s leg, or a zucchini, or a rose petal. I’m limited and I’m okay with that; truth with a lowercase ‘t’ is fine. Frankly, I prefer to contemplate the penumbra of mystery.</p>

<h3 id="choices">Choices</h3>
<p>For the book I am writing, I have been reading about the field of Disability Studies. This discipline questions the concept of disability as something that exists outside the social construct of what it calls ‘ableism’. While certain people may possess impairments, such as a missing limb, or the inability to see, hear, or walk, it is society and its practices that transforms these impairments into disabilities.</p>

<p>In this diagnosis-obsessed age, where many child behaviors that a generation ago would have been ascribed to individual temperament are today given fancy names (and often, “treatment” in the form of powerful medications), Disability Studies provides a provocative reminder of the constructedness, and therefore the arbitrariness, of notions such as health and illness, able and unable, sane and mad. The purpose of this awareness is not to minimize the impact of any condition, illness or impairment on a person or family, but rather to recognize that our understanding of these conditions, etc., are not only mutable but often predetermined without our awareness.
To understand what I mean, let’s examine the condition known as Down Syndrome. Or rather, let’s examine an article written by John M. Starbuck entitled “<a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=jca">On the Antiquity of Trisomy 21: Moving Towards a Quantitative Diagnosis of Down Syndrome in Historic Material Culture</a>” in which Starbuck attempts to identify visual evidence of Down Syndrome in past sources of material culture, such as painting.</p>

<p>For instance, Starbuck looks at these three paintings, all from the mid-15th century, painted by the Italian Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506). He considers the evidence that these paintings depict children with Down Syndrome strong, based not only on the representation of “several phenotypic features associated with Down syndrome,” but also on reports that Mantegna himself had a child with Trisomy 21. However, Starbuck admits that, alternatively, it is possible that Mantegna’s representation of children may have been due to his “artistic style,” and therefore have no dispositive value as evidence of the historical presence of Down Syndrome.</p>

<p>While it is more likely than not that this chromosomic duplication existed in previous centuries and millennia, Starbuck’s investigation into its history seems flawed in its most basic premise, in that he is trying to look at the past with the eyes of the present. Arguably, this is what we must do inevitably, when we study the remnants of ages past; however, part of scholarship is acquiring additional, contextual knowledge that allows us to see, as it were, through another’s eyes. Starbuck is finding what he is <em>looking for</em>—the phenotypic features associated with Trisomy 21—but completely failing to grasp that that is not what he is <em>looking at</em>—iconic depictions of the Madonna and Child.</p>

<p>Let me try to convince you that my objection to Starbuck’s inquiry is not tautological. It is not a matter of ignorance of chromosomes then and awareness of them now—<em>of course</em> that is the case. My objection is more fundamental, namely that it is a different kind of seeing that gives us icons then and phenotypes now.</p>

<p>The way we see things now has a lot more to do with the medical/scientific tendency to categorize and systematize than we may realize. This trend has its origins not only in philosophical trends regarding scientific observation as the basis of knowledge, but undoubtedly the historical trend toward greater, denser, and more mobile human populations has encouraged this framework in which individuals are viewed as—and, as Disability Studies scholars would argue, often reduced to—exemplars of identified conditions, disorders, diseases, anomalies, etc. While it seems perfectly natural to us to speak of “normal” children and ones with “birth defects,” these interdependent concepts are not only inventions, but relatively recent ones.</p>

<p>A frequently-expressed concern within Disability Studies is the increasing use of selective abortion based on genetic screening. In India and China, it is common to abort females due to a preference for boys; while this kind of selection is neither as widespread nor as socially acceptable here, it is the case that nine out of ten fetuses with Down Syndrome are (quietly) aborted. This statistic suggests, perhaps indisputably, that this condition is undesirable, a status that Disability Studies finds troubling, given its implications for the many individuals alive with Down Syndrome and other “disabilities”. The reasoning goes: “If we continue to abort these fetuses on the basis that they are less normal, and therefore less desirable, what are we saying about the worth of the individuals born with this condition—or any other condition construed as somehow unacceptable?” Or, from a more personal point of view: “If it is acceptable to abort a fetus that is/has X, had my parents known they might have chosen to abort me!”</p>

<p>While this line of reasoning certainly tugs at the heartstrings, I am not convinced by it, as it fails to take into account the most fundamental characteristic of all living things: contingency. Regardless of our preferences, we deal with the reality of the contingent all the time, inevitably. Things happen that we cannot plan for or prevent, and we manage, we cope, sometimes we even thrive. On this basis, I do not think it devalues a disabled person who is now living in the world if a woman chooses to abort a fetus that has what the medical establishment conceives of as a genetic “abnormality” or “defect”. One has no bearing on the other. Certainly the choice to abort expresses the opinion of the woman about her continued willingness to carry and raise the child—indeed, it constitutes a refusal. But I would hesitate to construe this refusal as an ethical pronouncement on the value of “life,” whether in general or of specific individuals. How can one person in one action condone or refuse something so big, so expansive, so obviously in excess of one’s own limited capacity?</p>

<p>While I believe that refusal is within her rights—by the fact that it is within her capacity—I do not equate this refusal with a moral declaration of any sort. All of our lives are so fundamentally contingent, that to speak about a “right” to be born or a “right” to live in the sense of a moral prerogative seems at best idealistic and at worst fatally naive. I do not judge a woman who aborts a fetus with Down Syndrome; the narrative of “this is not what I want for my life” is one we all use to navigate the myriad choices that define and redefine our lives. You may find this narrative selfishly repugnant, you may have sympathy with it. At the heart of both is the common struggle with contingency. The woman who aborts based on genetic tests refuses ultimately in ignorance, for she cannot know what that child will really be like, what she will feel, what will be the nature of the care she must give. She can assume, she can fear, but she cannot know. The woman who does not abort also does so in ignorance, for to carry and raise any child carries the same level of contingency, as the same abyss of ignorance yawns before each new life—even those magical, precious “perfectly healthy babies.”</p>

<p>The only sure thing is contingency. Everything is contingent but God.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that people who moved to the New World worked very hard; they had to, and even then, their survival was not guaranteed.

Even now, the dream of immigrants is not to find gold on the streets (although I think we did go through that phase), but to work hard to earn the means to a better life.</p>

<p>As the weeks pass into months in this laboring hiatus, I have been reflecting a great deal on what it means to work, or to not work, and the true meaning of those terms. Like many terms, they take their meaning(s) from context. In general, working connotes the performance of activities for compensation, activities that most people would not engage in—or at least not under the same terms and conditions—were they not so compensated. Working is therefore an obligation, imposed upon us so that we can secure the money that we then exchange for the objects and services (commodities) we require to shelter, clothe, feed, transport, and amuse ourselves (and any dependents we may have).</p>

<p>Second only to the necessity of work is the expectation of loving and/or excelling at one’s work. This is how the necessity to work is naturalized, in that work becomes part of one’s individual character rather than an aspect of a system that, while dominant, is hardly, as Marx notes, “natural.” The person who offers his labor for sale, i.e., as a commodity, Marx notes, must be in a state of freedom: he must be <em>free to</em> alienate his labor from his person, meaning, he must not be a slave, who is owned outright, and thus cannot alienate his labor-power. While there is an obvious positive to being free in this sense, the other freedom Marx identifies is a bit more fraught: he must also be <em>free from</em> the ability to produce commodities himself, which he would then trade for (or sell in order to buy) items he needs but does not directly produce. In other words, he must be alienated from the means of production.</p>

<p>From this perspective, joblessness takes on a greater meaning, for it threatens one’s very survival and prosperity. Indeed, plenty of families and individuals have lost their homes, equity, and savings as a result of long-term unemployment and the corresponding loss of income. For many, even if they do find work again, these changes in lifestyle are likely permanent. While it may be crass to delineate a scale of misfortune, the fact that many upper-class families are permanently losing their financial status built over years of work strikes, at least in me, a particular chord of fear, pointing out the fundamental instability of any prosperity that depends on continuous wage-based employment.</p>

  <p>For instance, it may be that machines will take over most of the work that is of real, practical importance, but that human beings will be kept busy by being given relatively unimportant work. It has been suggested, for example, that a great development of the service industries might provide work for human beings. Thus people would spent their time shining each other’s shoes, driving each other around in taxicabs, making handicrafts for one another, waiting on each other’s tables, etc. This seems to us a thoroughly contemptible way for the human race to end up, and we doubt that many people would find fulfilling lives in such pointless busy-work.</p>

<p>I can remember thinking, as a child, quite unprompted, about garbage, and where it all went, and whether there was room for it all wherever it went. This was before the days of curbside recycling, green bins, and reusable shopping bags—although it was still the time when paper bags were the default, and I think we used them in the bin, rather than buying garbage bags, at least at that point.</p>

<p>I recall coming to the conclusion that if this potential problem had crossed my mind, it must have certainly crossed the minds of adults, of truly wise and responsible people, and that therefore I could feel reassured that the situation was being handled. Of course, as I grew up, I learned that this was not entirely true. Landfills were filling, and yet our population kept growing, our footprint kept expanding. And this was good, this growth, because growth was the lifeblood of our economy.</p>

<p>High school vignette 1: When the unabashedly Marxist history professor, beloved by all, taught the meaning of the term <em>reification</em>, the main example he used was the economy. I still think of that whenever I hear the economy discussed on the news, which is of course all the time.</p>

<p>High school vignette 2: One assembly, we watched a video presentation made by the group that called itself, at the time, Zero Population Growth (ZPG). (Since 2002, it has called itself <a href="http://www.populationconnection.org/site/PageServer">Population Connection</a>.) The video was a time-elapse representation of human population. As time progressed, dots representing a million people would appear on the map, indicating population growth. The only time a dot ever disappeared, the voiceover noted, was during the black plague. Poof.</p>

<p>We now know, it seems, that there is such thing as too much of a good thing. And we have too much of everything. Too many people, too many farm animals, too many cars, too much garbage, too much pollution. We also have the too muches of maldistribution—certain folks have too much money, while others have none; many people in the industrialized world eat too many calories, while famine persists (not to mention the conundrum of being overweight <em>and</em> food insecure, a daily reality for many in this country); and all of us living in the world of <em>mercatus triumphans</em> have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?ref=magazine" target="_blank">too many choices</a> among the things we consume, while others have little or none.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t dare suggest that scarcity is a comfortable or easy thing, but it does seem that our human history has better equipped us to deal with scarcity than with the non-abundant excess that is the hallmark of late capitalism. Humans live better in abundance, I think we can all agree on that, but we aren’t necessarily more satisfied with excess than we are with scarcity. This may sound absurd at first read, but I think if you pause and reflect for a moment, you will see my meaning. Excess simply isn’t a basic human need; indeed, it is because of their excess (in the form of cheap and ubiquitous processed foods) that fat, salt, and sugar have gone from a regular, moderated part of the human diet to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Overeating-Insatiable-American-Appetite/dp/B004NSVE32/" target="_blank">pariahs needing to be exiled</a>, lest we all perish from overconsumption. While I don’t question the scientific data that such foods are “chemically addictive,” it is most certainly the context and not the content of these substances that has changed. I haven’t done the research, but I feel pretty confident that 100 years ago no one was talking about bacon as a dangerous drug.</p>

<p>Certainly, we are designed to be incentivized to secure abundance: we work the land so we can eat, we make things so we can live more safely and more comfortably, we invent things so that we can longer and in better health. But when that work is done, we are incentivized (by our sore muscles and spent minds) to rest, recover, and restore our energies for the next necessary exertion. There is something perverse to me about the idea of sitting at a desk all day in order to have money to go to the grocery store in order to carefully avoid the majority of the products there that, if we succumb to their built-in temptations, will ruin our health. Abundance is great, excess not so much.</p>

<p>As Marx points out in his investigation of the mysterious substance called capital, and the socio-economic system that grew up around it, excess is key. Excess is where all the magic is (hear the irony), the magic that turns Money into More Money (M â†’ M’). And by the logic that no capitalist would inject his money into the market in order to come away with an equal amount of money, it follows that no capitalist would stop putting his money into the market when he can, in so doing, make more money with it.</p>

<p>Historically, the source of the majority of this excess was the surplus value “hidden” in labor-power. Increasingly, however, it is possible to make money out of money with very little human labor, or perhaps with a lot of labor by a very small percentage of the population. Automation has made our lives easier, and technology has made them longer, but only at the peril of making them unlivable—our labor is not needed, and we run out of money long before we run out of needs, troubles, or breath. Driverless cars are a great example of this industrial-world dilemma: <a href="http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2011/04/google-engineer-claims-its-driverless-cars-could-save-a-million-lives-every-year.html" target="_blank">relinquishing the wheel to machines would save an estimated million lives a year</a>, but it would also eliminate numerous jobs, therefore making it more difficult for people to ‘earn the living’ for the life preserved by a safer highway.</p>

<p>I’m certainly not trying to romanticize pre-industrial life. But I do think it is time that we question the notion of work, that we examine why, as Kathi Weeks notes in her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Problem-Work-Feminism-Imaginaries-ebook/dp/B005KGTQ0O/" target="_blank">The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics, and Postwork Imaginaries</a></em>, “the fact that at present one must work to ‘earn a living’ is taken as part of the natural order rather than as a social convention” (Kindle Location 46-7). “The mystery here,” she says in the opening lines of the book, “is not that we are required to work or that we are expected to devote so much time and energy to its pursuit, but rather that there is not more active resistance to this state of affairs.” (KL 18)</p>

<p>Certainly this reevaluation is not simply a matter of finding new, or reverting to old, ways of sustaining ourselves on the planet. It is matter of rethinking our social relations, for almost every institution and individual is defined, at least in part, around the notion of work. Weeks writes:</p>
<blockquote>After the family, waged work is often the most important, if not sole, source of sociality for millions. Raising children with attributes that will secure them forms of employment that can match if not surpass the class standing of their class standing of their parents is the gold standard of parenting. (KL 93-4)</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, as Weeks goes on to explain, preparing people for work is the goal of the educational, medical, and social welfare establishments, justifying (although increasing unjustifiably, these days) the prison system as well as encouraging people to volunteer for the military. In short, “[t]he social role of waged work has been so naturalized as to seem necessary and inevitable, something that might be tinkered with but never escaped.” (KL 99)</p>
<h3>Idleness</h3>
<blockquote>Longshoremen, like everybody else in the world, like to sit down a lot. When I first came on the waterfront, one of my first jobs was working coffee on the dock. My partner was a black man with a big belly who was getting along in years. When we turned to that morning the gangs on the ship had to rig the booms and uncover the hatches, so we had a little time before we got our first load. My partner spent that time searching around collecting two-by-fours and other scraps of lumber. Finally I got tired of watching him and asked him what he was doing. He did not reply at first, but busied himself with poking the lumber into a stack of pallet boards just inside the door of the shed, beside the ship. Finally he had four two-by-fours sticking out at a convenient height above the floor, and he turned around and sat down on them. He had two one-by-eights protruding out on either side of him, a little higher than the two-by-fours, for arm rests. His fingers were laced together across the front of him, comfortably holding up his big belly.

"Son, you haven't been down here very long, have you?" he said, looking at me speculatively.

"No, I haven't," I acknowledged.

"Well, boy, I'm going to tell you how to get along on this waterfront. When you come to work in the morning, the first thing you do is construct yourself a good seat. And the second thing you do is make sure you use it a lot."

In this world, sometimes the best of advice just drops in your lap. (42-43)
<p style="text-align: right;">--_Reg Theriault_, How to Tell When You're Tired:
A Brief Examination of Work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on your frame of mind, you will smile or frown at this longshoreman’s working-day motto. You can either sympathize with his desire for rest, given the sheer physicality of the work—especially as it existed in the middle decades of the last century—or you can sympathize with his employer, who is not paying for him to rest but to work. Or, I suppose, you might wonder at the existence of jobs where sitting was the exception, not the norm, and even wish for one.</p>

<p>Work, by definition, is not always easy or pleasurable, but it is necessary. But how this necessity is understood, and who decides it, is a matter of context. When you are plowing a field in order to eat, or making a horseshoe to sell in order to buy other things you need, the parameters of the necessary are self-evident. But when someone is paying you to unload coffee from a ship in exchange for a day’s wages, the necessary becomes harder to parse. If the ship gets unloaded in a reasonable time, within the schedule of the larger workings of the dock, to whom is it necessary that the longshoremen do not sit down on the job, or only do so at prescribed, negotiated intervals? The logic of capitalism doesn’t work like the logic of toil… capitalism wants as much work as possible for its money, while any individual knows that the less he toils, the better.</p>

<p>Theriault’s memoir of his life as a manual laborer in this country is as laugh-out-loud funny as it is rigorously insightful. Part stories, part reflections, Theriault gives us a slice of the history of the worker, a history he notes that, on a global, millennial scale, has largely been lost beyond recuperation. The book provides a glimpse into the nature of work as an <em>activity</em> engaged in by workers and its complex interactions with the <em>idea</em> of work promulgated by the people who hire and manage workers. As can be imagined, often the ideas about work don’t fit very well with work itself. What seems logical in theory—greater efficiency, greater productivity, increased automation, lower labor costs—doesn’t always make for better work, either in practice or in outcome.</p>

<p>Spending so much time around my house these days, I have time to stare out the window, idle. A rather sizable spider has made a web outside my front door, in the 90-degree space between the side of the house and the eaves. She sits, sometimes in the middle of the net, sometimes hidden in a corner by the house. She waits as mosquitos and other flying food sources meet their doom. She reacts nervously as the web shakes when I raise the mailbox lid (to which the web is attached). She has lain eggs in sacs of silk; we have seen some of them hatch (creepy). One evening, I watched as she tended the sacs and rewove parts of the web that had deteriorated. I tried to imagine what it would be like to be a spider, one who does what we would call work without the mental framework to theorize it. What is work, or idleness, when you are driven purely by instinct? Living, perhaps?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*        *        *</p>
<p>I keep occupied, and I feel busy, but I miss work. I miss the money, I miss the workday rhythm, and I miss the subtle feeling of satisfaction—so American!—of “going to work,” a feeling that somehow manages to creep in no matter how much I might also hate the job itself.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I will work again, as I’m still at the relatively early end of my working years. And let’s face it, people my age are probably never going to be able to retire, or at least not in the way of our grandparents and parents.</p>

<p>I try to think stoically in those moments when the isolation gets to me, I remind myself that “this too shall pass,” and I remind myself to focus on how lucky I am, compared to many.</p>

<p>And I think of the spider, waiting, and weaving when needed.</p>

<p>It is commonly said that “the past catches up with you,” but in my own life, anyway, I have often found that I am the one doing the catching up; I believe I am moving away from the old, only to find myself unexpectedly face to face with forgotten ideas and endeavors.</p>

<p>This accidental return describes the way in which I came to “specialize” in Italian theater during my doctoral studies. Looking back, I can plot the trajectory of how my first love, theater, and I became separated. At the time, however, it seemed like some sort of cosmic accident that after six years of graduate school, I was searching for the plays that would form the core of my dissertation.</p>

<p>There is something incredibly satisfying about the dimensions and directness of a play, the way it takes dialogue and confrontation for granted, even demands it. Certainly many curtains have fallen on the dead, the distraught, and the despairing, but even the saddest of dÃ©nouements nonetheless fulfills the need to have things out that life itself often denies us. Certainly, moving on is the trendy attitude of the empowered and savvy, who break up via SMS, but there is beauty in the brilliant articulation of full-fledged crisis, in the moment-by-moment turning of lives in the time of the breath, the time of the word.</p>

<p>And sometimes, there are happy endings.</p>

<h3 id="è-più-capriccio-che-un-dramma">È più capriccio che un dramma</h3>
<p>The French film <em>Va savoir</em> (2001) is about love, theater, and the love of Italian theater. Camille Renard is the lead actress in an Italian theater troupe, headed by her partner Ugo Bassani. Troubles surface from the start: Camille is troubled by memories of her ex-boyfriend Pierre, whom she left when she left Paris three years before, and Ugo is distressed at the growing financial straits of the company, made increasingly dire with low advance sales for the Paris run.</p>

<p>Camille’s own return to the scene of her past, one that still haunts her, is magnified by the play the troupe is performing, Luigi Pirandello’s <em>Come tu mi vuoi</em> (which is most typically translated as <em>As you desire me</em>, but <em>As you like me</em> would be just as accurate, plus providing a charming echo of Shakespeare). In this play, Pirandello tackles several of his favorite themes: the subjectivity of truth and the impermanence and instability of identity. Camille’s character, L’Ignota, the Unknown, is a woman who may or may not be the long-lost wife of Bruno, but she is willing to follow Boffi (Bruno’s advance man, played by Ugo) back to the Veneto from Berlin, where she lives a dissolute life, despite the objections of Salter, the psychologist who has fallen in love with her and taken her in. She desires to be just a body, and let Bruno reanimate her, according to his memories, according to his vision—as he would wish her to be.</p>

<p>The film deftly weaves together snips of the performances and off-stage action, giving us a streamlined version of Pirandello’s play along with Camille’s exploration of her own past. She cannot resist going to Pierre’s apartment, where she used to live with him, only to meet his new financée, Sophie, there. She does however find him in the park, sitting on the same bench reading the same paper (Die Welt) as he used to each morning. Only the title of his dissertation has changed, having been shortened to simply “Heidegger, le jaloux.” (All you non-academics, trust me that this is a big deal.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ugo is mining a different kind of past, the literary one, looking for an unpublished play of Carlo Goldoni, one he reportedly wrote as a gift for a friend who helped him out financially. His search takes him to the Vernet collection, presently in the possession of the first wife of one of Vernet’s great-grandchildren. Thus the film’s cast of characters expands to include Marie-Pierre’s two children: the parasitical, thieving Arthur from her first marriage, and the beautiful, resourceful Dominique (Do) from her second.</p>

<h3 id="il-ny-a-rien-de-tragique-tu-sais-je-tassure">Il n’y a rien de tragique, tu sais, je t’assure</h3>
<p>Camille does not feel free of Pierre after their brief but inconsequential encounter. She writes him and explains that she will leave two tickets for him and Sophie for the show the following night. He comes, but alone, after which they walk, and talk, and he invites her and Ugo to dinner. Remarkably, an appearance of normality seems established between the ex-lovers.</p>

<p>But things are not as they seem, neither for Camille or for Ugo. Dominique assists him with the search for the manuscript within the collection, but leads him to understand that all is not as it seems… strange things, she says, happen “dans cette maison, dans cette pièce,” which means “in this house, in this room,”—except that the word <em>pièce</em> in French can mean also “play” or “furniture” (among several other uses). It is perhaps the ultimate word to describe something that is contained, or arranged, or placed, and all of its senses are certainly being invoked in this film, and in the play at its heart.</p>

<p>Arthur is not only revealed to be the purloiner of an occasional manuscript, and strangely close to his half-sister, but also a seducer of women, including, we soon see, Sophie. The crisscrossing between the six characters is complete when, after the disastrous dinner between the two couples, Camille goes to visit Sophie at the dance studio where she teaches ballet, and there runs into Arthur. In addition to the various personal motives pulling these characters together, the play itself serves as a center point, as all of them go to see it at one point. (Do even goes twice, first with and then without her mother.)</p>

<p>As Dominique falls in love with Ugo, Camille seems unable to resist further involvement with Pierre. Though embarrassed by Ugo’s behavior at the dinner, she seems equally disturbed by Pierre’s increasing effusiveness toward her. If perhaps she was not sure at the beginning whether she was over him or not, when she goes to see him, she explains in no uncertain terms that she has moved on, that she loves what she does and whom she does it with. But Pierre believes her actions more than her words, and in an unexpected turn reveals that, in his opinion, nothing has changed, and nothing will—he has been waiting for her for three years, and this time he intends to keep her. And he shuts her into a small room in his apartment and leaves.</p>

<p>Calmly, Camille escapes via the roof, and rushes back to the theater with just enough time before the show, apologizing for her lateness but also letting off steam, remarking that it was hardly as if she’d died.</p>

<h3 id="è-finita-la-commedia">È finita la commedia</h3>
<p>It is to the death, however, the duel to which Ugo challenges Pierre—the place being the catwalk above the theater’s stage, and the weapon being bottles of vodka. The two men will drink, and the first to fall loses. This challenge is a lovely take on Pirandello’s own more serious commentary on the dangerous practice of duels in another one of his plays, <em>Giuoco delle parti</em>, managing (as does the entire film, really) to embrace all the seriousness and sadness of Pirandello’s ideas within the hopefulness of a modern comedy—safety net included.</p>

<p>Happiness prevails all around, as all the main characters end up together on the theater’s stage for the movie’s finale. What has been lost or obscured is recovered, but the weight of the past is removed. Camille takes advantage of Arthur’s (genuine?) obsession with her—brought on by her beauty and her portrayal of the Unknown woman, with whom he identifies—in order to beat the con man at his own game, using the pretext of a one night stand to steal back the valuable ring he had stolen from Sophie. The ring itself, with the inscription “Time flies, love remains,” is a reminder of Sophie’s own past as the girlfriend of a thief and her ten months in prison. Yet when Camille presents Sophie with the ring, she tells her to keep it, having firmly committed herself to her future with Pierre, to whom she is devoted despite his obvious eccentricities.</p>

<p>Even Do’s hurt at Ugo’s gentle rejection of her gives way to glee as she realizes the old book her mother pulls off the cookbook shelf is indeed the Goldoni play,_ Il festino_—not destino—<em>veneziano</em>. With the swap of one letter, the strangely un-Goldonian sentiment resolves into his familiar comedic spirit. During the finale, Do presents the manuscript to a drunken Ugo, who can hardly believe it. He warns her again that if she lets him stage it, its value as an unpublished manuscript will disappear, but she encourages him, telling him if he stages it, she will come to watch. (Although one wonders if this dream will come to pass, given that Arthur is sitting right near them, likely overhearing this discussion.) The half-siblings thus continue as before, dancing together as the truly odd couple they are.</p>

<p>At last, then, Ugo and Camille are reunited, her romantic past behind him, his search for his elusive Goldoni ended. Not only has the strain between them disappeared, but Sophie’s gift of the valuable ring to Camille has saved the troupe. She will go with him after all not just to Vienna (the tour’s next city), but “to the end of the world.”</p>

<p>Rideau.</p>

<h3 id="common-ground">Common ground</h3>
<p>I have a definite memory of seeing the painting pictured above, Jean-Francois Millet’s <em>Des glaneuses</em> (<em>The Gleaners</em>), in the Musée d’Orsay in Paris as an adolescent, but I’m pretty certain that I did not know at the time what a gleaner was, and did not take that opportunity to find out. Or if I did, the knowledge didn’t remain.</p>

<p>Gleaning is the agricultural practice of collecting leftover crops after a field has been harvested. In the Torah, God commanded that every farmer leave a portion of his crop purposefully not harvested and to leave the gleaning to others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your land or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the alien. I am the Lord your God. <em>(Lev. 19:9-10)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Book of Deuteronomy reiterates and elaborates on this obligation, further specifing that this is commanded because of the Israelites’ past as slaves in Egypt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the alien, the fatherless and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow. When you harvest the grades in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this. <em>(Deut. 24:19-22)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly this practice is a form of charity, or welfare, but it is a very specific kind thereof. It is not a direct handout, but rather an opportunity to reap sustenance through the labor of harvesting. In this way, it affirms the notion that the land and its fruits are in some respect still common to all. While communal farming is starting to make a comeback, particularly in the form of the urban or school garden, these activities are irrelevant to gleaning; not only are they small-scale, but they are designed as a supplement to other food sources, being relied upon merely to promote the availability of fresh and ultra-local produce to the community or school.</p>

<p>Gleaning, on the other hand, occurs at the margins of widespread cultivation, relying not only on freedom of access but also on the purposeful creation of excess like that commanded in the Torah. By the phrase “creation of excess” I mean the designation of a share of the crops as irrelevant to one’s own interests—economic or otherwise. It is simply left alone, in the fields. In this sense it is in fact the opposite of a surplus, which is harvested and counted and considered, often to the detriment of the economic viability of farming, given the negative effect of oversupply on prices.</p>

<p>The social implications of the differences between gleaning and modern food welfare (food stamps, food pantries, soup kitchens) are telling. Indeed, it would be a mistake to think of them as equivalents at all. Besides the obvious differences in procedure, there is also the fact that gleaning is intended (at least in the Bible) to help not merely the poor, but specifically those who lack community ties (as may aliens, children without fathers, and widows) that would admit them access to more direct forms of assistance. In this sense, gleaning is not commanded so that the members of the community might eat (a human right) but as an extra-communal right, so that <em>anyone</em> might live off the land (an alien right). Gleaning is not taking care of the community, but rather of people who, for one reason or another, may have fallen through its initial safety nets.</p>

<p>Purposefully here, I am tweaking the traditional understanding of “human rights” as the broadest possible extension of freedoms—both “freedoms to” (e.g., speak, practice a religion), and “freedoms from” (e.g., hunger, destitution). Possibly, we have not done ourselves any favors by using the category of our species as the largest and most legitimate criteria for the application of the Golden Rule. Certainly, the notion (and even the formal declaration of) universal human rights hasn’t done much to end the widespread and multiform miseries of poverty, war, violence, exploitation and repression on this planet.</p>

<p>We are good, on the whole, at caring well for those with whom we have close ties or allegiances (friends, family, maybe neighbors, or fellow members of a religious group). The Christian ideal—the gospel brought by Christ—is the notion that we treat everyone as our brother in Christ. Given the emphasis on the “chosen” nature of the Jews, this is absolutely a revelation, but it does not mean that the Old Testament had no awareness of the need to extend sustenance to all. The Torah’s commandment to create excess is aimed precisely at this goal, and it does so without requiring any feeling (brotherly or otherwise) toward the potential gleaners, nor any action on their behalf. Indeed, it is a non-action, a leaving alone, and it is done not in relation to one’s fellows at all, but in relation to God.</p>

<h3 id="fruit-of-the-vine">Fruit of the vine</h3>
<p>Last week I had the opportunity to assist a local (to my home town, Oakland, CA) winery called <a href="http://www.ulcellars.com/">Urban Legend</a> in its semiannual bottling. Of course the grapes aren’t grown in town, but the wine is made and aged in Oakland’s warehouse district, just a few blocks from the train tracks that lead to Jack London Square. Making wine requires a fair amount of equipment and space, but getting it into bottles efficiently and safely is a process all of its own, and when it only occurs twice a year, it makes sense to outsource the bottling rather than purchasing the equipment oneself. Not only is this feat possible, you can even have the bottling facility come to you rather than vice versa: Urban Legend bottles its wine using <a href="http://ultimamobilebottling.com/">Ultima Mobile Bottling</a>, which shows up with a truck that contains a compact bottling plant.</p>

<p>Urban Legend supplies all the pieces that went into the process: the wine (which is run through hoses from the winery into the truck), the bottles, their boxes, the corks, the capsules (that’s the foil part), the labels, and the box labels. Friends and associates of the winery owners served as the labor. While the process is mechanized, it is not entirely automated: the bottles need to be unboxed, herded into the assembly line, with the boxes then placed above the packer’s heads; the capsules need to be dropped on the full, corked bottles; the bottles need to be boxed; and finally the boxes labeled and stacked on pallets. The filling of the bottles, the corking, the sealing of the foil onto the top, and the bottle labeling are all done automatically, but of course the whole process needed to be monitored, and was by the two young men from Ultima, who fed corks into to the cork bin and regularly checked the bottles for the correct pressure.</p>

<p>While I’m not stranger to the concept of industrial production, it is quite another thing to see it in progress. As a sight not commonly witnessed in person these days, especially in a truck, it proved marvelously fascinating. To work at the pace and rhythm of a process that has mechanism instead of mind made for a lot of giggling, I’m not sure why. Maybe it was the novelty not only of bottling wine, but of doing so on an Oakland street. During the first run I labeled boxes as they came down off the truck. (I put them on upside down, since the wine boxes would be stored with the corks down, being flipped over before placed on a pallet.) The second shift I got to do perhaps the most exciting part, which was to case the bottles as they came down the line. I was working with a woman who had a lot of experience, and so she taught me the most efficient practice, which was for us to actually fill the same box: she would get the box down from the rack, put six bottles in it, then pass it to me for six more, after which I would close the lid and push it into the automatic taper, after which it slid down a short ramp to be labeled and stacked. By the time I’d done my part, she’d started the next box, so there was very little idle time for either of us.</p>

<p>Someone usurped my position as a packer for the next shift, so I went to join my father, who was installed in his usual role of dropping the capsules onto the corked bottles. It was feasible in one, but it was easier and more social in two. But as the job that required the least full-body movement, it was the most painful. Before long, my back was killing me. Part of that was my unideal footwear, but most of it was due to the simple fact that the human body in general, and mine in particular, doesn’t take to that kind of standstill, repetitive labor. I can walk for miles happily outdoors, but even a brief trip through a museum—slow walking, standing—will give me a backache in short order.</p>

<p>My father and I left after the morning shift, roughly four hours of work. Rewarded with a nice lunch and two bottles of wine each, we returned to the car, tired and sore. Certainly it had been an entertaining morning, but the idea of working that way everyday, all day was a dreadful one. Not that sitting on a chair in front of a screen all day is necessarily any easier on the human body, but I’d managed that before, whereas I couldn’t see myself ever adjusting to life on a factory floor. But even more to the point, despite my fatigue and sore back, I felt that a few hours of factory-like labor had made for a charming volunteer experience, whereas I couldn’t see myself “volunteering” to pilot a desk for a half day. And I thought it was odd, on some level, that the basic premise of a commodity-filled (if no longer -based) economy, i.e., manufacturing, appeared to me as something exotic, a hidden world brought rarely into view, despite the complete dependence of my lifestyle upon it.</p>

<h3 id="staff-of-life">Staff of life</h3>
<p>Gleaning, I learned recently, is making a comeback, albeit within the system of industrialized agriculture. As NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/133059889/gleaning-a-harvest-for-the-needy-by-fighting-waste">reported in January</a>, increasing effort is being made to reclaim food that would otherwise simply be wasted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Food gets left in the field for all kinds of reasons. Two big ones are that mechanical harvesting misses a lot—and sometimes the crops aren’t pretty enough for supermarket shelves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“The statistics are that 96 billion pounds of food are left—this is pre-consumer food—goes to waste in this country,” says Linda Tozer of the <a href="http://www.endhunger.org/">Society of St. Andrew</a> an organization that coordinates farmers around the Southeast and out West.</p>

<p>(St. Andrew is a rather mysterious saint, best known as the patron saint of Scotland—although see <a href="http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/articles/2001-andrew-women.htm">this fascinating piece on his connection to women’s rights</a> (all the more interesting given that Andrew means brave, manly. The society is perhaps named for Andrew because of the fact that it was he who brought to the attention of Jesus the boy whose loaves and fishes would be miraculously multiplied to feed the five thousand (John 6:1-14).)</p>

<p>While there is no doubt that the Society (and others) are delivering on the mission to feed the hungry from field leftovers, the circumstances that make gleaning possible are completely altered in the present context, as the owners of the fields are leaving food on the field not in fulfillment of a religious (or “humanitarian”) mandate, but of an economic one: the food is either simply missed by mechanical harvest methods (and thus too expensive to harvest manually) or it is not good enough to be sold. It is neither excess nor surplus, it is simply waste.</p>

<p>Also while I was in California this time, I heard the news that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/us/14bcfema.html">Bay Area food banks will take a significant funding hit</a>, losing $1.5 million in funding from the Emergency Food and Shelter National Board. San Francisco (which is a county and a city), along with Marin and Napa counties, will get none of the remaining $1.9 million allocation.</p>

<p>In this economic climate, this couldn’t be worse news. Sadder still is that, it seems, no one (or very few people, anyway) is in favor of people in the richest nation on earth going hungry or being food insecure. And yet here we are… our government, supposedly for the people and by the people, is making these choices.</p>

<p>I wonder, although perhaps naively, whether charity and the creation of excess were easier in an agrarian economy, whether it was simpler to understand and share abundance when most people worked on or in relation to the land. Have we created wealth, an invisible, magical, numerical concept, at the expense of the palpable, nourishing, uncountable notion of excess?</p>

<p>What can we leave in the fields for today’s gleaners, now that we have already left the land?</p>

<h3 id="seeing">Seeing</h3>
<p>Temple Grandin is perhaps the most famous person currently living with autism. Autism, or more properly put, Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a diagnosis that describes a neurobiological disorder that results in various developmental disorders. The range of impairments, both in arena (social, motor, sensory, intellectual/cognitive) and severity, is so great, however, that truly meeting one child with autism gives you an idea of <em>that</em> child and <em>his</em> (less likely hers) autism. One child may communicate verbally, another may be entirely non-verbal. One child may crave physical attention, another may not tolerate human-to-human contact. A high-functioning autistic may be able to live relatively independently as an adult, while many will need high-level, lifelong care. </p>

<p>But movies must be made about individuals, not about diagnoses. The HBO film <em>Temple Grandin</em> gives us an incredible outlier of autism in its brilliant protagonist who came of age at a time when autism was much less understood (as for schizophrenia, the “refrigerator mother” was blamed) and also much less prevalent. While the former circumstance provides plenty of opportunities for those wistful “but now we know better” moments, the latter one allows us (indeed, the film encourages us) to see Grandin through a lens that can only be described as anti-diagnostic. When we meet her, she is a young adult who appears outwardly as a conforming member of 1960s society; even if her aunt needs to remind Temple to mind her manners, she is not one of a type, and she is not spoken of in terms of her autism by her aunt and mother—even if, as we see later in flashback, she was given the autism diagnosis as a child, and exhibited many of the commonly associated behaviors (verbal delay, tantrums, avoidance of physical contact, extreme pickiness with food).</p>

<p>But Grandin is exceptional, not only as a person with autism, but as a person. Although she does not talk until age four, she becomes verbally fluent and is not physically or cognitively impaired; quite the contrary, the way her brain processes the world through images gives her incredible visual-spatial abilities. She can see things in the world, and see them in her mind, and navigate between these two worlds with incredible ease and precision. The film’s use of special effects (mostly schematic or graphic overlays onto images of the real world) masterfully put us into Grandin’s mind, allowing us to experience how it is she sees. It is with this skill that she redesigns her aunt and uncle’s ranch gate to open at the pull of a rope and close automatically, allowing 47 seconds to drive through.
While autism is associated with heightened abilities in certain areas (“savant” gifts, as they were called in the era of <em>Rainman</em>), Grandin’s ability to communicate and express her unique vision makes her an extremely high-functioning autistic, a clear outlier. Despite the obviously rote quality of her ”I’mTempleGrandin nicetomeetyou,” her discomfort with physical contact with others, and her obliviousness to social cues and practices, she is engaged in the world around her—particularly with the world of animals, from which she receives as much as she later will give in her work on animal behavior and techniques for humane treatment of stockyard cattle. It is from the management of cows that she borrows the notion of gentling, discovering that the application of pressure on her body calms and relaxes her during her attacks of anxiety or sensory overwhelm. Though she has to fight to keep her custom-designed “hugging machine” in her college dorm room, the film makes clear not only that Grandin’s relationship to her condition is extremely rare, even unique, but also that she faces equal if not greater obstacles from society, specifically, the intense sexism in the cattle-ranching industry.</p>

<p>As for Grandin’s attitude toward her condition, it is marked by a supreme self-awareness. While the film surely expects us to cringe as the doctor explains to her Harvard-educated mother the theory of maternal lack of affection in “childhood schizophrenia” (aka autism), this scene can be considered the straw man to the later scene in which a bumbling Freudian psychologist mistakes Temple’s literalism (her notion of “release” is not orgasm, but the point at which she releases herself from the grip of the machine) for an admission that she derives sexual pleasure from her hugging machine. Not only is he wrong, but Temple herself is blissfully immune from any of his implications of shame. The result is pure comedy, at the expense of the diagnostic establishment.</p>

<p>As in the early part of the film, however, an essential feature of this antediluvian world of knowledgeable diagnosis is Temple’s personal awareness of the necessity of self-mastery. She is obviously different, but her relationship to the world is not governed by a sense that it should accomodate her. If stores are going to get automatic doors, she is going to have learn to go through them. Again here, it should be emphasized that Grandin is an outlier on the autism spectrum, having not only the insight to know what she can and cannot learn—she knows, for instance, that she will never be able to learn how to read the communicative signals of the human glance—but also possessing the capacity to learn to cope with her condition, to face down her fears. The hugging machine helps, but she knows that on occasion she will have to manage her anxiety without it. She prefers not to be touched by people, but she can overcome this in certain circumstances, for instance, to assist her blind college roommate. In this way, the film is able to transform Temple Grandin’s particular struggle with her unique form of autism into a more general case of triumph over difficult circumstance of whatever variety.</p>

<h3 id="hearing">Hearing</h3>
<p>A lesser known film, <em>Under the Piano</em>, takes us even further back in time, beginning in 1930s New York. As the title suggests, the protagonist of this film is much less accessible than the communicative Grandin. The young Rosetta Basilio is one of many children born into a musical family, but she does not speak and is prone to anxious and sometimes self-injurious fits. Her mother loves her, but looks at her condition as a limitation, a perspective that is somewhat self-serving, as she will increasingly (as her other children go out into the world) use Rosetta’s dependence as a definition of her own identity. Rosetta’s next-older sister, Franny, however, who herself must learn to cope with the disability of a lame arm, sees her sister as needing not just care but also room to flourish. Rosetta is extremely musically talented, but while her mother dismisses her abilities as mere mimicry, absent of feeling, Franny cannot fail to see her sister’s intelligence and compassion. In a wonderful dinner scene, while the family bickers over Rosetta’s condition (which of course is not discussed in diagnostic terms), she silently cuts up all the meat on her plate and then stealthily switches her own plate with her sister’s, thus relieving Franny of a task made difficult by her useless hand.</p>

<p>This care dyad between the two sisters manages to overcome a communicative gulf that is unflinchingly presented—Rosetta is barely verbal, and when she speaks she is prone to echolalia, meaning she often repeats what is said to her rather than giving proper responses. She is very much “in her own world,” as is often said about autistic persons, but Franny knows where the overlap is between her sister’s world and that of the rest of us, and encourages the meeting of the two, whether it be by taking her to the opera or finding them both work in a Catholic hospital cafeteria—where it is discovered that, in addition to her musical gifts, Rosetta has exceptional fine motor control, and can quickly, neatly, and contentedly prepare the innumerable sandwiches served in the wards above.</p>

<p>Things fall apart, however, when Franny gets married and leaves for the west coast, leaving Rosetta in the increasingly self-serving care of her mother. When Rosetta breaks her leg, her mother does everything she can to discourage her recovery (which she equates with abandonment), and her own depression eventually suggests (knowingly?) suicide to Rosetta, who drinks ammonia one night in imitation of the death scene in her favorite opera, <em>La Forza del Destino</em>.</p>

<p>Franny, who serves as a force stronger than destiny in her sister’s life, arrives for a visit just in time to drag her to the hospital and save her life, first by preventing her death, but later by insuring that she does not disappear into the nascent netherworld of «modern» psychiatry, defined by institutions and straightjackets and unspecified interventions—scary quotes indeed, those! While the misguided and harmful treatment of mental patients during this period is well known, the film’s choice to contrast Rosetta’s autism with the blank stare of a lobotomized woman (the word is not spoken, but we of course know) firmly insists that whatever the apparent distance between Rosetta and the world, it is to the world that she indeed belongs.</p>

<p>Here is the way in which this story, like that of Temple Grandin, is also exceptional. Rosetta, though possessing an uncommon musical ability, is in many ways representative of a larger autistic population, as is unable to be entirely self-sufficient. What set her story apart is her sister’s exceptional care and companionship, which provides her with a comfortable, (relatively) autonomous, and satisfying life. The film’s final shots, of Rosetta playing the piano as her mother lies dead beside (almost under) it, brings us full circle to the earlier scene from which the movie takes its title, namely that of a young Rosetta hanging out under the piano as it was played. She has outlived her mother, but more importantly she has survived her mother’s well-intentioned but restrictive notion of care. She has flourished.</p>

<h3 id="being">Being</h3>
<p>In the bright sun of summer, in the glare of persistent ignorance, the daily reality of diagnosis and its accompaniments is glorious, but the right hand of the camera turns away from what is left.
More of what I know is from sitting and serving in a state of redundancy. I sang a lot, and became aware of how many lyrics from the songs of my childhood I had forgotten, even though the melodies remained, like loyal old friends.</p>

<p>My mother told me recently of a time when I was young, and we were at a park, and a man asked her why she was teaching me animal sounds. Because, she replied, automatic like a See-N-Say, that is what you do. But then she thought about it more and wondered why indeed.</p>

<p>One early time I forgot to run an errand because my mind was so full, so blank, I just drove home on autopilot.</p>

<p>These children… we made them a group, and in my terrible triage I learned their names instead of those of the women around me, those wise, persistent, humble women. There was no restriction on me to love, and so I did. I watched mysteries unfold and persist and picked up some tricks and only later than you’d think, noticed the soft scars on a hand too often bit.</p>

<p>As expected, there wasn’t a lot of gaze-meeting, but there was a lot of hugging, of hand-holding, of laughing and jumping, coaxing, and one-sided conversations that went as the hands on a clock. Beginnings without greetings, and endings without goodbyes. Swings.</p>

<p>I mean no cruelty, but we are all a bit slaves to our perceptions, and they come up from the ships’ galleys and report unflinchingly that no one is home, or so it seems. I puzzled over an expression that seemed identical to that of an overstressed, high-powered academic I knew, except B.D. had no context I could know that could account for that acute frown.</p>

<p>The most crucial ingredient in beauty is superfluity. And America doesn’t have a lot of faith in, or practice at, enforcing an aesthetic. We keep order, and make cubicles, and we show up, but personally I wanted to be—and still do want—more of a <em>vigilante</em>.</p>

<p>I reject evaluation for myself and for these children, these adults, the former that will become just by waiting the latter. All measure of contribution is negotiable, and I no more will be put on someone’s bottom line than I will put someone else there. Am I the only person disgusted by <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/health/video-peter-bell-on-handling-the-upcoming-needs-of-autistic-adults/10806/">Peter Bell arguing for why autistics can make valuable employees</a>? No one has ever been saved by the (closing) bell.</p>

<p>The best advocates understand their own uselessness, and how to smile for no reason.
The first denial comes from too much love, from the sinews of recognition, the persistence of willingness. The final denial, <a href="http://being.publicradio.org/programs/2011/autism-and-humanity/">at the end of a long discussion</a>, came to me as a punch in the stomach… the assertion that their autistic boy would “always need services.”</p>

<p>You service a car, or a sewing machine. Throw all the denial at me you want, but the necessity is that of care.</p>

That was just a basic premise, and lowering such taxes rates on these folks was not a major part of either party’s platform, let alone a key plank in a bass-ackwards theory that maintains that keeping taxes low on corporations and the super rich creates jobs.</p>

<p>Say something enough times, though, and it starts to sound important, and then it starts to sound true. I believe this is what has happened in the case of the Republicans. Arguably, they are protecting their own money and that of their political contributors, but they are doing so with a rabid fury that cannot be motivated merely by even the most pernicious greed. As so often happens in our lives, we form our convictions based not on experience but on anticipation of experiences, i.e., fear and dread. Meaning, in short, that thinking about paying more taxes is worse than actually paying more taxes ever really was.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that it felt great <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/fed_individual_rate_history-20110323.pdf">40 years ago (1971) to be taxed</a> more regressively (up to a marginal rate of 70% on your income over $200,000). But not only was it rare (because so few people earned that much money), it was considered entirely normal. And normal is really what matters, i.e., it’s not the policy that matters so much as your attitude toward the policy. Not to mention the fact that if you are a family grossing $95,100 (which is what households in the 95th percentile of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Household_income">median income were earning in 1970</a>) and taking home $52,850, you have a lot more in common with people earning $35,900 and keeping $25,600. This regressive marginal tax scheme doesn’t equalize the two household incomes, but takes them from a ratio of 2.64 to 1 down to 2.06 to 1. Yes, the wealthier family is surrendering a greater percentage of its overall income (44% versus 29%), but in exchange it is gaining a larger interest in the common good. If you don’t have as much purchasing power in the private market, you are naturally more interested in the public commons, such as decent public schools, government services, and Social Security benefits. I’m not going to say that this is fair, but I am going to say that it serves an identifiable, functional purpose: this way, the wealthy and the average are in it together, and that makes you more sure of one another.</p>

<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>Terrence Malick’s <em>The Tree of Life</em> is a movie about God, at least according to white people. Not that the Creator of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s <em>Strength to Love</em> can’t be discerned somewhere in there, but let’s just say that civil rights and social justice are peripheral to this film, which poses the question of the human-divine relationship within the more narrow context of a mother’s grief over the death of her middle child, one son of three born and raised in the stern yet precious America of the 1950s (specifically, that of suburban Texas).</p>

<p>I confess I adore this film, even though I think it would have been better had Malick forced himself to cut out 15 minutes or so, including the scene with the dinosaurs by the river. Film, which is inherently a distillation of life though its use of metonymy (part for whole; i.e., an entire life is suggested through the presentation of select scenes), is perhaps the ideal medium for a meditation on spirituality, for spirituality is often understood as a distillation of our own existence, a reduction of the experience of life to its essential feelings and, if you are so inclined, meaning.
The film is beautiful in its vagueness, in the fact that we are left guessing why R.L. (the only name given to the middle son, and this only in the credits) died at 19. My guess is Vietnam, but this is pure conjecture. What is certain is that it is essential to this film’s work to depoliticize death in the same way that it idealizes life – both must take on spiritual and even archetypal aspects. This is not a film of small questions, or of petty emotions – how could a film with a epigraph from the Book of Job be such?</p>

<p>But the film is also beautiful in its directness. It does not pretend not to be a spiritual film. From the first voiceover of the riveting, understated Jessica Chastain as the future Mrs. O’Brien (see above), Malick boldly shows his hand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nuns taught us there were two ways through life: the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you’ll follow. Grace doesn’t try to please itself. Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked. Accepts insults and injuries. Nature only wants to please itself. Get others to please it too. Likes to lord it over them. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things. The nuns taught us that no one who loves the way of grace ever comes to a bad end. I will be true to you. Whatever comes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what comes, sure enough, is trouble.</p>

<h3 id="trouble">Trouble</h3>
<p>There are commercials that depress me, several in particular. One is an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5UQkwCuB90">iPhone commercial</a> in which this woman is using said device to cheat on a radio quiz game (after lying that she hasn’t played before). With her ability to browse the Internet and talk on the phone simultaneously, she is able to answer the question about America’s deepest lake with a bored ease, after which she is faced with the list of prizes she can choose from, all of which she already has, of course. With the same bored resignation, she chooses a second bouncy castle.</p>

<p>The other one is also a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wkHsiL4Enc">smartphone commercial</a>, this time advertising Sprint’s HTC EVO 3D, the first phone that shoots and plays 3D video (no glasses required). Some kids are playing ping-pong, and the father is videoing them with his phone. Quickly he decides that the way they are playing isn’t taking advantage of the potential of the 3D capabilities, so he switches places and returns a slam on (presumably) his son’s serve. When his daughter, who is holding the phone, asks him, understandably, wtf that was, he replies, “That was 3D gold.” Because it’s all about the phone, apparently.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if am building for myself a reputation on this blog as a sort of a neo-Luddite, although obviously not the kind that rejects technology outright: I have a blog, I adore my iPhone, I can’t imagine life without the Internet. I guess I am the kind of neo-Luddite that senses a lamentable, generalized effect of technology on our society and culture. I don’t want computers and the Internet to go away, but I also don’t want to be made to desire a 3D phone or television just because some corporation needs to make most of us buy another gadget so it can continue to make money. And believe me, I wear no rose-colored glasses about my ability to resist advertising and marketing. I could care less about TV, really, but when I go home I tease my parents fairly relentlessly about not owning even one set that can handle high definition. So in short, what depresses me about those commercials is not that I am some strange outlier; rather, it is the fact that, but for the grace of God, surely there go I.</p>

<p>For a place founded on a philosophy and experience of rebirth, second chances, and revivals—in short, of <em>betterment</em>—it seems odd that contemporary America consistently promotes the young to fame—and often, accompanying fortune. We have young athletes, young singers, and young inventors… including Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook and subject of last year’s award-winning biopic, <em>The Social Network.</em></p>

<p>I saw this film with my father a little over 9 months ago. It is engrossing and witty, neatly capturing the ethos of the early 2000s during which the age of the the Internet became the age of Social Networking, a phenomenon first limited to the young, but now considered indispensable by soccer moms, grandmas, small business owners, self-promoters, and, of course, corporate America.</p>

<p>Knowing in advance that Zuckerberg’s creative blitz of code-writing ends, eventually, in the banal “find us on Facebook” refrain, we cannot help but watch the initial scenes of inspiration with a touch of chagrin. For me, this chagrin was mixed with a strange kind of nostalgia, the recall of younger days in which I believed that the combined blessings of youth and brilliance were unstoppable forces of good, and that if I recognized and loved a boy’s keen mind, that his heart would bear gifts to match: compassion, insight, and kindness.</p>

<p>Creativity, alas, no more guarantees happiness than a seed-head scattered by a girl’s breath promises a patch of dandelions. Come down through the cosmos, inspiration’s energies are invisibile, winding their wild ways not in allegiance to the artist’s vision but to the much vaster entropy of Source. Watching Andrew Garfield (playing Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZRr4KV59I">write out critical algorithms</a> (for Zuckerberg’s beer- and revenge-fueled FaceMash) on the window of Zuckerberg’s dorm room, thus visually manifesting the wondrously strange, almost magical (to me, anyway, as an ignorant outsider) process of computer programming, I felt keenly the contrast between that foreshadowing of Zuckerberg’s programming triumph and the state of confusion that reigned in my own creative life.</p>

<p><em>The Social Network</em> tells the story of creative success, certainly, but at high social cost. The tangled web Zuckerberg weaves out of code and social curiosity disrupts as much as it purports to connect, drags him down as much as it elevates him to worldwide recognition and sky-high net worth. As the brothers Winklevoss learn, something is rotten in the state of preppy-dom; Harvard president Larry Summers represents the academy—supposed last bastion of gentlemanly honor and fair play—as tone-deaf to the brothers’ concerns of integrity over a website that doesn’t sell anything. The latter phenomenon is too new, while the complaint of ungentlemanly conduct is too old, and has been lost in the academy’s conversion from self-effacement to self-promotion. The doorknobs may be old, but even the old-boy network needs new money. Summers has bigger fish to fry than settle what appears to him as a playground dispute brought by whiny children.</p>

<p>Disputes over the genesis of technological inventions are as old as inventing itself; the Wright Brothers and Samuel F. B. Morse, for example, struggled as mightily with patent law and profiteers as they did with planes and port-rules. Neither self-propelled flight nor magnetic telegraphy was invented in a vacuum, without partnership and cross-pollination. In that sense the legal notion of inventorship is a convenient fiction, but perhaps the inconvenient truth of this last century’s turn is the way in which friendship itself has been redefined not only by the process of invention but by its products. With friends like Zuckerberg… well, you need a lawyer.</p>

<p>And so the lawyers brought everyone to the table, listened to the stories, and taped band-aids of undisclosed millions over the wounds, real or imagined, of Facebook’s creators, actual and potential.</p>

<p>With this cautionary tale, my own rescue mission began.</p>

<h3 id="mission-accomplished">Mission Accomplished</h3>
<p>The other night, my father and I took a much-deserved break from our DIT projects (that’s DIY, but “together” instead of “yourself”) and the mugginess of Virginia summer to watch the film <em>Super 8</em>. It was the only choice, since everything else playing (not counting <em>Midnight in Paris</em>, which my dad had already seen) was either animated or asinine. (I’ll have to go see <em>Cars 2</em> by myself I guess!)</p>

<p>So with popcorn and drink and no more than a dozen other people in the theater, we slipped into the narcotic haze of cinematic narrative, letting the air conditioning cool our bodies and the digital images redirect our imaginations.</p>

<p><em>Super 8</em> is also a film about creating—indeed, it is about making a 8mm movie—but it is a creation of a different time and place. It is 1979: the Walkman is new, the Russians may be coming, but the real Bad Guy is the US Air Force that has tortured a monstrous-looking alien being that accidentally crashed to earth years before, refusing to let it go because it has this magical building material that it can morph, apparently through mental power alone, into anything, including the most amazing spacecraft ever seen. In this sense, the film is doubly about creation, because the alien is being held prisoner due to the interest the military takes in his creative ability, determined to steal what it cannot invent itself.</p>

<p>The two plots intersect when the movie-making kids witness the daring attempt to free the alien by their biology teacher, Dr. Woodward, by derailing the Air Force train in which he and his magical creative cubes are being transported. A former scientist on the Air Force team that imprisoned him, Woodward has since been working to free the alien, having experienced a mystical communion with him when the alien picked him up. “As soon as he touched me, I knew,” he recounts for the tapes he keeps in his secret “dungeon,” a trailer behind the school. Without words, the alien was able to communicate to Woodward that all he wanted was to go home, and his anger was only a response to the frustration and confusion of his captivity.</p>

<p>This bonding moment is repeated between our young protagonist Joe Lamb and the alien, at the film’s climax, when the motherless (due to an accident at the Lillian steel mill) Joe is grabbed by the huge monster. He, too, knows instantaneously the alien’s agony, and soberly is able to reassure him that, although bad things happen, you can start again… there are second chances. Maybe not second chances for those who have died, but for the living there can be love again, just as the alien can finally go home.</p>

<p>It is this same optimism that guides Joe’s best friend, Charles Kaznyk, in his film hobby. The film-within-the-film, <em>The Case</em>, is a zombie murder horror/detective movie with a happy ending, and is the young director’s submission to the Cleveland, Ohio <em>International</em> Teenage Super-8 Movie Contest. There is an innocence about the presentation of this final gasping breath of the 1970s, where houses were messy but mothers cooked, kids bickered but the family was still happy, and no one had A.D.H.D. or was obese (pudgy Charlie just hasn’t “leaned out yet” as the doctor puts it). Kids were kids, and they snuck out of the house, drove their parents cars without licenses or permission, but nothing terrible was going to happen to them. Even when they witness the most incredible train wreck, the blood at the scene is Charlie’s fake movie blood, and they return home dirty and freaked out but otherwise no worse for the wear.</p>

<p>Watching Charlie’s enthusiasm for writing, shooting, developing the film (entailing a minimum 3-day turn-around), and editing it (cut and splice!), we feel appropriately nostalgic for this age-of-innocence creativity story. There is a wholesomeness that seems to attach itself retrospectively to older creative technology; the age of the 8mm film is presented as an age of patience and dedication in spite of (what we now see as) technological limitations, selfless collaboration (Joe feels obligated, by virtue of his friendship, to help Charlie finish his movie), and pure motives—the film is created as art-for-art’s sake, with the goal of recognition of a kind that now seems positively archaic: review by a select few for the granting of a prize.</p>

<p>Compared to the instant viralization of video today, how effortless a moving image can be recorded, edited and disseminated, the late ’70s teenage filmmaker and his volunteer posse is offered up to us as part of a larger antediluvian vision of American culture. Past and present dangers, such as Vietnam and Three Mile Island accident, are acknowledged peripherally, but the trouble and triumph of the film is represented in the liberation of the creative alien and the completion—old friendships and precious model trains still intact—of <em>The Case.</em> Creating, from filmmaking to modeling (which is Charlie’s apt description of the before-our-eyes composition of the alien’s incredible spaceship) is not only magical, it is the source of good that is intuited at a level beyond speech: “As soon as it touched me, I knew.”</p>

<p>And so Alice is rescued, and the misunderstood artist is free, at last, to create and to go home.</p>

<p>A happy ending—or rather, a new beginning.</p>

<p><em>Thanks, Dad, for coming to see these movies with me. You know the good you have done.</em></p>

<p>The beauty of taking something on faith is its fortitude in the face of changing circumstances – through the storms of experience, faith provides a stalwart buttress to our vulnerable resolve.</p>

<p>But few are those for whom faith comes easily in all matters, and so we must instead bear the tempest of experience until we acquire mastery. For me, one of my greatest fears was that the human body did not float in water. Or rather, that <em>my</em> body did not.</p>

<p>This doubt persisted through years of (fruitless) swim lessons, and only abated one summer, when, as a teenager, I spent a lot of time in the water, and one day casually realized that, indeed, like everyone else’s, my body did indeed float.</p>

<p>But this casual conversion was merely the beginning of a much longer road to mastery, mastery of technique and mastery of fear. I took swimming lessons in graduate school (I often joke that that was the most useful thing I got out of my doctoral education) and then about two years ago, went back to the pool as an exercise regime. While my foggy memories of grad school instruction gave me enough courage to improve my comfort and stamina in the water, it was only through private lessons that I was able to genuinely learn the proper technique, and to discover the bliss that comes from a supreme confidence in the pool. Moves that had once seemed impossible to me (flip turns, for example) were now becoming a routine part of my workout. And each day, I am still improving.</p>

<h3 id="moving-on">Moving on</h3>
<p>After 55 years in a house in central New Jersey, my grandparents are moving. Not only are we saying goodbye to this house, full of countless memories, my grandmother and I are saying goodbye to “the lake,” the nearby pond that has served as a fixture of her life, and my summertimes here, for decades. My grandmother, a woman who just a year shy of 90 could be mistaken for a woman in her 70s, swam daily after work in that lake, simply because she loved that water, and the energy that exercise gave her. Since I was a little kid, it was not just the water that drew her there, but the company of the “ladies of the lake,” a group of women, mostly divorcÃ©es a few years her junior, who have gabbed away the afternoons, moving to follow the shade, passing around treats, and providing sympathy and congratulations through their lives’ many burdens and blessings.</p>

<p>And so it was a week of goodbyes and good luck wishing, as my grandmother moves south, away from this longest of summer traditions. It was goodbye for me, too, but it was also a thrilling few days, marked so appropriately by the Independence Day holiday. After all of those years confined, humiliatingly, to the shallows, I went and swam the lake proper, fearlessly, effortlessly, gliding through that water as my grandmother did decades ago, delighting in its natural warm and cold spots, and enjoying its refreshing cool under a shining summer sun.</p>

<p>And I can’t remember what it feels like to be scared of the water. I can remember <em>being</em> that way, but I cannot summon the physical fear I once had. The water will hold me. I take it on faith.</p>

<h3 id="we-of-little-faith">“We” of little faith</h3>
<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">RadioLab</a> this weekend, and the theme was <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2010/jun/28/">Oops</a>, that is, the unintended consequences of various human endeavors, from the comical (automatic find-replace editing in newspapers and the like) to the catastrophic (the death of the world’s oldest tree; the Mack Lake fire). One segment included a description of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2000/06/chase.htm">a multi-year experiment conducted on a group of Harvard undergraduates</a> beginning in the fall of 1959 by an eminent professor in the Department of Social Relations, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Murray">Henry A. Murray</a>.</p>

<p>As part of this experiment, subjects were asked to write an essay in which they expressed their deepest convictions, hopes, and ambitions. They also took a multitude of tests and gave detailed revelations of their most intimate thoughts, feelings, and fantasies. After being told they would meet to discuss their essay with another student, they were instead subjected to brutal interrogations in which they and their ideals were abusively attacked. In subsequent meetings, they had to watch the video footage that was made of their (predictable) meltdown during the initial interrogation.</p>

<p>One of the students who participated (with consent, but not with what is today known as informed consent) was a very young sophomore named Theodore J. Kaczynski, a gifted student who would go on to become a tenured mathematics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Subsequently, however, he withdrew into the Montana wilderness and, beginning in 1978, started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski#Bombings">to mail or deliver bombs</a>. Kaczynski is, as you may recall, the terrorist dubbed the Unabomber (in reference to his preferred targets of <em>un</em>iversities and <em>a</em>irlines). Despite a lengthy and costly investigation by the FBI, he was caught only after his brother David recognized the ideas he had long expressed privately in a 35,000 word manifesto (entitled “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm">Industrial Society and its Future</a> that the Unabomber leveraged <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The New York Times</em> into publishing, saying that he would send another bomb if his request was not granted. Since he had already killed 3 people and injured 29 others, the papers, on the advice of the authorities, complied on September 19, 1995.</p>

<p>The author, who identifies himself in the text by the name FC (which Kaczynski later insisted stood for “Freedom Club”), explains why modern (industrial, “organization-dependent”) technology is destroying human experience, and argues for an active revolutionary movement in order to destroy the technology that has taken from human beings not only their natural environment, but also their ability to reliably satisfy their basic goals (i.e., those of survival) through significant effort. FC believes that the autonomous and effortful labor toward our survival is is fundamental to human fulfillment; he refers to these critical needs as the “power process”.</p>

<p>Modern technological society, he argues, has taken away these opportunities, and in so doing has made fulfillment of the power process impossible for most people. We (or at least the incredibly large majority of us) are able to satisfy the basic needs of food, shelter, clothing, etc. with minimal physical or mental effort. The main requirement of keeping a job, FC repeatedly states, is obedience, and as obedience is the opposite of autonomy, it blocks fulfillment of the power process. Therefore we must try to satisfy our need for attainable goals in other ways, with what FC calls “surrogate interests,” which is basically anything that you would no longer do if you were adequately challenged by providing for your survival/social needs on an individual/small group basis. He dismisses the notion of curiosity as the motivator of scientists, who were the Unabomber’s main target:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Science and technology provide the most important examples of surrogate activities. […] As for “curiosity,” that notion is simply absurd. Most scientists work on highly specialized problems that are not the object of any normal curiosity. For example, is an astronomer, a mathematician or an entomologist curious about the properties of isopropyltrimethylmethane? Of course not. Only a chemist is curious about such a thing, and he is curious about it only because chemistry is his surrogate activity. Is the chemist curious about the appropriate classification of a new species of beetle? No. That question is of interest only to the entomologist, and he is interested in it only because entomology is his surrogate activity. If the chemist and the entomologist had to exert themselves seriously to obtain the physical necessities, and if that effort exercised their abilities in an interesting way but in some nonscientific pursuit, then they wouldn’t give a damn about isopropyltrimethylmethane or the classification of beetles. Suppose that lack of funds for postgraduate education had led the chemist to become an insurance broker instead of a chemist. In that case he would have been very interested in insurance matters but would have cared nothing about isopropyltrimethylmethane. In any case it is not normal to put into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the amount of time and effort that scientists put into their work. The “curiosity” explanation for the scientists’ motive just doesn’t stand up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For FC, the generating of such specialized knowledge is an almost perverse surrogate for the more basic experiences of a more “primitive,” small-scale, and nature-connected lifestyle. FC idealizes this kind of lifestyle, and gives a rather layman’s analysis as to why that way of living is more conducive to human happiness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In primitive societies life is a succession of stages. The needs and purposes of one stage having been fulfilled, there is no particular reluctance about passing on to the next stage. A young man goes through the power process by becoming a hunter, hunting not for sport or for fulfillment but to get meat that is necessary for food. (In young women the process is more complex, with greater emphasis on social power; we won’t discuss that here.) This phase having been successfully passed through, the young man has no reluctance about settling down to the responsibilities of raising a family. (In contrast, some modern people indefinitely postpone having children because they are too busy seeking some kind of “fulfillment.” We suggest that the fulfillment they need is adequate experience of the power process—with real goals instead of the artificial goals of surrogate activities.) Again, having successfully raised his children, going through the power process by providing them with the physical necessities, the primitive man feels that his work is done and he is prepared to accept old age (if he survives that long) and death. Many modern people, on the other hand, are disturbed by the prospect of physical deterioration and death, as is shown by the amount of effort they expend trying to maintain their physical condition, appearance and health. We argue that this is due to unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never put their physical powers to any practical use, have never gone through the power process using their bodies in a serious way. It is not the primitive man, who has used his body daily for practical purposes, who fears the deterioration of age, but the modern man, who has never had a practical use for his body beyond walking from his car to his house. It is the man whose need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best prepared to accept the end of that life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FC’s idea of fulfillment, of self-realization, to introduce a term he does not use, but that seems appropriate, is very much concerned with physical, immediate experience – the satisfaction of immediate needs, and an interaction with nature that, he argues, results in humans being comfortable with the changes that any creature, by definition, must undergo within its lifespan. FC is unhappy, and his commitment to calculated, cold-blooded terrorism plainly evidences his anger. Yet the kind of lifestyle he imagines that the abandonment of technology would make possible is downright idyllic, one in which human beings are no longer plagued by the pervasive anxieties of modern life. In this sense, FC is a despairing optimist: he has the capacity to imagine man (in the abstract) living well in his environment, but he lacks hope that these conditions can be realized in reality – even for himself.</p>

<p>Indeed, the saddest part of FC’s manifesto has to be the palpable sense of loneliness it exudes. Here he is, fearless champion of boys who would rather run around outside than study science, proponent of a back-to-the-land, small-group (extended family, local community) social units – in short, he is a dreamer committed to principles upon which a solid, satisfying life could undoubtedly be built (and, to a certain extent, were indeed built in the past). But in reality Kaczynski lived as a hermit in the Montana backwoods, and felt clearly doomed to obscurity by the very technology that seems to have (apparently) convinced the rest of us that we can have a voice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. Take us (FC) for example. If we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted. If they had been been accepted and published, they probably would not have attracted many readers, because it’s more fun to watch the entertainment put out by the media than to read a sober essay. Even if these writings had had many readers, most of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read as their minds were flooded by the mass of material to which the media expose them. In order to get our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression, we’ve had to kill people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think this is true, and probably neither do you. But Kaczynski does. And one cannot help but wonder how much of a hand the (ominously-named) Department of Social Relations at Harvard had in the formation of the imaginary “Freedom Club,” the club of one. Its “we” is a sadly ironic version of the old “royal we,” as well as its post-Revolutionary equivalent, “we the people.” FC is someone whose faith in humanity has been shattered, leaving only behind a rhetorical remnant of a sympathy toward, and solidarity with, fellow human beings. To dismiss this response (as has been done in Kaczynski’s case) as the exclusive product of biochemical aberration (i.e., mental illness) not only promotes not only a cruel, inaccurate association between violence and mental illness, but also denies the importance of our obligations toward one another as social beings.</p>

<h3 id="faith-and-reason">Faith and Reason</h3>
<p>If the hallmark of philosophy is to theorize what is true in general, in the abstract, the marker of the conversion experience is in the recognition of one’s own particularity – that one lives in a specific place and circumstance.</p>

<p>The liberating potential of this realization is the beauty behind Leo Tolstoy’s religious transformation, in which he goes from a depressed and suicidal man of no faith to a Christian believer. He chronicles this conversion in his book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=D7kGiJpUOxgC"><em>A Confession</em></a>. First, he explains the origin of his despair, and the role of reason therein:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I, that is my reason, have acknowledged that life is irrational. If there is nothing higher than reason (and there is not, and nothing can prove that there is), then reason is the creator of life for me. Without reason I can have no life. How then can reason deny life when it is the creator of it? […] Life is everything. Reason is the fruit of life and yet this reason rejects life itself. I felt that something was not quite right here.<br />
Life is a senseless evil, that is certain, I said to myself. Yet I have lived and still live, and so too humanity has lived and still lives. How can this be? Why do men live when it is possible not to live? Can it be that only Schopenhauer and I have been intelligent enough to understand the senselessness and evil of life? <em>(Ch. 7)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tolstoy’s perception that his feelings aren’t shared by a large number of people suggests to him the possibility that, regardless of his internal conviction, he may be missing something. His concept of reason shifts from the notion of individual discernment to an openness to experiences that he has not had, but that need to be considered in the formation of a more complete understanding. He comes to see his reason as not self-endowed, but given to him by collective human life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, since those long ago days when life began and of which I know nothing, people who knew the argument about the vanity of life (which seems to me to prove its senselessness), have nevertheless lived and brought to life a meaning of their own. Ever since there as been some form of human life, people have had this understanding of life, and have pursued this life, and passed it down to me. Everything that is in me and around me is the fruit of their understanding of life. These very instruments of thought with which I judge life, and condemn it, were made by them and not by me. I myself was born, educated and grew up thanks to them. […] They taught me how to think and speak. I am their offspring, provided by them with food and water, taught by them, able to think and speak using their thoughts and words, and now I have proved to them that it is all senseless! “There is something wrong here,” I told myself, “I have made a mistake somewhere.” <em>(Ch. 7)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mistake that he had looked for his answers only among people like himself, and had confused their experience and analysis for total, true knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought that this narrow circle of scholars, and of rich and distinguished people, to which I belonged made up the whole of mankind and that the millions who had lived and still live were THEM, some sort of cattle, people.<br />
It seems so strange to me now, so utterly incomprehensible, that in my reasoning of life I could have overlooked the life of humanity that surrounded me on all sides and that I could have been so ridiculously mistaken as to think that my life, and the life of Solomon and Schopenhauer, was the true, normal life, while the lives of millions was not worthy of attention. [But at the time] I felt so certain that all these millions simply belonged to the category of those who had not yet penetrated the depths of the question, that as I searched for the meaning of my life it never once occurred to think: “What sort of meaning to all the millions who have lived, and do live in the world give to their lives?” <em>(Ch. 8)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once Tolstoy shifts from deduction to induction, from ratiocination to observation, he is able to formulate a new relationship to reason, and thus a new way to seek the answer to his fundamental questions about the meaning of life. He is forced to acknowledge that in addition to rational knowledge, there is also irrational knowledge, which is “possessed by humanity as a whole: faith, which affords the possibility of living.” Rational knowledge is not capable of answering Tolstoy’s questions because, “[t]he only answers the sciences give to this question are identities.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having understood this, I realized that it was impossible to search for an answer to my questions in rational knowledge; that the answer given by rational knowledge simply suggests that the answer can only be obtained by stating the question in another way, by introducing the question of the relation of the finite to the infinite. I realized that no matter how irrational and distorted the answers given by faith might be, they had the advantage of introducing to every answer a relationship between the finite and the infinite, without which there can be no solution. <em>(Ch. 9)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tolstoy breaks with Descartes, knowing that he does not exist because he thinks, but rather that he exists because everything exists, and he is part of the infinite. And he must look toward the varied millions who are also part of this infinite, and learn from them the answers he seeks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I looked more widely around me. I looked at the lives of the multitudes who have lived in the past and who live today. And of those who understood the meaning of life I saw not two, or three, or ten, but hundreds, thousands and millions. And all of them, endlessly varied in their customs, minds, educations and positions, and in complete contrast to my ignorance, knew the meaning of life and death, endured suffering and hardship, lived and died and saw this not as vanity but good. […] It was the activities of the labouring people those who produce life, that presented itself to me as the only true way. I realized that the meaning provided by this life was truth and I accepted it. <em>(Ch. 10)</em></p>

<p>“Faith is the force of life,” Tolstoy writes (in Ch. 9); it is what preserves the wisdom gained throughout history regarding the human relationship to the infinite. Where it resides, and where it must be sought, is not in the individual mind, but in our varied, intertwined, and collective lives.</p>

<p>Faith is a “we,” not an “I”.</p>

Which I learn today is not some weatherman’s bet, but rather the statistic that on 40 out of 100 days with these same conditions, it has indeed rained.</p>

<p>There are many things I could do, but mowing is one I must do, and I am grateful to have the energy to begin. Knowing I will be exhausted by the end of it, I could never find the willingness to begin without a minimal threshold of well-being. Indeed, afterward, I am peeling clothes off myself, depositing them in the washing machine and myself in the shower. I sit for a while with an ice pack on the back of my neck.</p>

<p>There is a joy to completing the labor our commitments ask of us, a satisfaction that is distinct from, but complementary to, the joy of leisure. Out west, I had some time to do a little nothing in particular… I took a trip to see a friend in Eugene, OR, and we drove around to see various places, like old covered bridges, the dunes and the ocean, the Cascades region, nearby towns. In Corvallis, we tasted wine near the park by the Willamette river as the town’s high schoolers gathered in their various interpretations of formal wear and took (and had taken) photos—it was the promenade part put back into the right of passage known as prom.</p>

<h3 id="promises-and-lies">Prom(ises) and lies</h3>
<p>The revelers are, and all look young, with impossibly firm bodies and evenly-colored skin, on display by many a girl’s backless dress. I don’t feel bad not thinking of them as “women”. They look to me as my classmates did over 15 years ago. They are beautiful, surely, but now I know how hard it is to be young, and I feel a vague sympathy for them. You couldn’t pay me to repeat those years. It is without nostalgia that, back in California, I toss out the pattern I used to make my boyfriend’s matching cummerbund and bow-tie—that matched, of course, my prom dress, which I also made. I believe that these articles themselves have long since met the dustbin.</p>

<p>It is almost shocking how little nostalgia I have for the past, how delicious it is to lower my sentimental footprint by getting rid of books I know I won’t read (again or ever), papers from the eons of my education, random bric-a-brac of years past. Instead I thrill to the changing of the guard, the reinvention of the old and the transition into the new. My mother and I come across the prom pattern while we are combining the contents of the separate sewing baskets that we’ve kept, hers from forever, mine from I guess the double digits of childhood.</p>

<h3 id="a-stitch-in-time">A stitch in time</h3>
<p>Finally she’s given up on her round basket that has long since started to fray at the top, and in a reversal of tradition, she agrees to inherit mine. So we carefully go through everything, condensing and sorting in preparation for consolidation. I feel an odd sense of victory that now my basket, which is admittedly ugly, is going to be ‘the basket,’ home of ‘the sewing scissors,’ and I ceremoniously position all the tokens of my childhood to which the old basket has long been home… a round photo of me at 4 or so made into an ornament (a sewing basket being as good a Jewish alternative to a Christmas tree as any), the snap applicator with its double set of light blue jaws that used to entertain me as a child, even though I have no memories of wearing the baby clothes my mother made with it. I delight in redefining our tomato pin cushions to work in concert, making one pins, the other needles, and twirling their strawberry ends together. I untangle and wind the most random colors of thread.</p>

<p>I tease my mom constantly about her nostalgia, her instinct for preservation of my childhood, knowing all the while that it is a bit unfair, like teasing someone who has a cold for sniffling. I am (as yet) childless, and therefore still immune from that particular affliction that I imagine is quite powerful, and reasonably so. Indeed, I am watching it happen with my newborn “nephew,” (actually my first cousin’s son, but I’m going to bribe him to call me aunt). I go with her and little Aidan to Guest Services at the Giant’s game to have a first-game certificate printed out. It comes with a great photo flyer celebrating the Giants 2010 victory in the World Series. One wonders how old he’ll be when they win again, and if he will inherit his parents’ passion for the team, carefully nurtured from 8,000 miles away in London. I wonder how he will feel as, years from now, he reflects as a boy or young man upon his baby book and tries to conjure an event the rest of us remember, but that he can only imagine himself into.</p>

<h3 id="country-roads">Country roads</h3>
<p>A friend is a good destination to lure me out into the country, a friend and a walk. My enjoyment of a pretty drive in the country is the exact inverse of my loathing of lengthy commutes, and I am charmed by the fact that the river trail we proceed to for an afternoon hike is actually familiar to me—I have been there once before, nearly a year previous, under much different circumstances. There is a unique pleasure to the unexpectedly familiar, and also to the fulfillment of simple pleasures prompted merely by circumstance, like a quick dip in a cool mountain water hole in a miraculous five minutes of privacy before the next cluster of hikers. Floating in the clear chill, face to the air and eyes to the sky, I am gleefully free of inhibition and its related sufferings.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, I stay for dinner at my friend’s landlord’s house, enjoying a great meal and a sweet celebration of Father’s Day. After dessert, I remember to call my grandfather to send my best wishes, and he complements me on the <a href="http://caljess599.github.io/2010/12/25/a-christmas-mitzvah.html">post I wrote about my great-aunt</a>, which I had enclosed in print copy in his card at my grandmother’s request. Maybe it is just the effects of a delicious day of leisure, exercise, and food, the generosity of strangers, and the charm of two well-mannered sons, but somehow when my grandfather tells me I have a way with words, I feel that my long-time dream of writing will come to fruition, someday, somehow… because there is a simple goodness about the idea.</p>

<p>On the way home, in the grey light of a fading cloudy day, I come to a stop on a narrow road—there is a cow on it, big, hulking, slow, and quite obviously out of place. I cannot not do something, even after it crosses the road and I can drive on. I don’t know why this is… because I love cows, even if they belong to the country and me to the city? Because they are valuable animals, and thus constitute someone’s livelihood? I can’t say. I pull over into a nearby driveway, and signal to a woman across a field, who signals to her husband, who—after a scary encounter between one tiny unleashed dog and a jittery hulking bovine (what I am worried about? my car? me inside? the cow?)—manages to usher it across the road, back towards is probable provenance. Then I can go. Home.</p>

          <p><em>In memoriam, W. J. A.</em></p>

<p>At the heart of the liturgical calendar is the notion that, in the year-to-year routine of our lives, we are better served by the celebration of a season, a course of days or weeks, than that of a single day. Certainly a particular day can hold special significance, but the calendar design suggests that we should contemplate and experience the major commemorative events for more than a mere 24 hours.</p>

<p>Last weekend I went to my first funeral. That I have made it this long without such an event is due only partially to familial longevity—the other reason is that my father’s relatives have chosen to donate their bodies to science, and parties were held instead of funerals. Memorial parties, of course, but it is hardly the same thing.</p>

<p>The pastor who led the service told us that the Easter season was the ideal season in which to celebrate Wendy’s life, for Easter commemorates the resurrection of Christ, and thus the promise of eternal life after worldly death for all of us. While I have no memory of ever discussing God or religion with Wendy, it so happens that I have been reading the works of the Christian theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, so I am better informed about the significance of Jesus in Christianity than at any previous point in my life.</p>

<p>Resurrection, however, remains a tough nut. Somehow, the question of origin seems easier to answer than the question of destination. Biological life, by its very definition, must have both beginning and end, but the miraculousness of birth, the beginning, is somehow more accessible. Even the notion of Christ’s incarnation, or in general the idea of the Divine taking human form, is easier to parse than the notion of human death, or the necessity that the same Divine form rise again after dying a human death. The resurrection is the greatest promise wrapped inside the greatest mystery.</p>

<p>Metaphorically, on the other hand, resurrection is quite easy to understand. Life is made of days but also seasons, and in some of them we fall, and hurt, and must lay fallow and rest, recover. Succor and help and rest give us new energy, new chances, new life. Death, in this metaphor, stands for crisis, a breaking point, a breaking down of the old out of which can arise the truly new. Sometimes there is no way to go forward without first going back, going down, going away for a while.</p>

<p>The key is in this “while.” Anything that you can come back from can be thought of as a blessing; no where more evident, at least for me, is the meaning of the Divine than in the witnessing of possibility, the reversal of our circumstances and attitudes. That which holds the place of what is, to you, impossible, and shows you, gradually, its possibility, is the Divine. It is what exists even when you do not see it, sustaining you, never separate from you, even in your deepest suffering.</p>

<p>What greater gift is there to be brought out of suffering, into the promise of a better time? This is the gift of crisis. Crisis is indeed, as an old saying goes, danger plus opportunity. And certain opportunities cannot be granted without that danger.</p>

<p>Wendy had a difficult life, the last thirteen years of which she spent courageously waltzing with the cancer that eventually took her off the mortal dance floor. Wendy was special, though, in that she was a woman who never expected things to be easy. She was understated, unfazed, unflappable. With the same keen calmness with which she accepted life’s trials, she made things wonderful (as in, full of wonder) in every arena—in the homes she made her own, in the simply gourmet meals she generously prepared for family and friends, in her teaching and scholarly work. Everyone who met her delighted in her, whether for her wit, her warmth, her intelligence, or all of the above. And never has there been someone so well-loved who spent less time currying favor. She was simply herself by virtue of not thinking too terribly much about herself.</p>

<p>And now she rests.</p>

<h3 id="inconsistency">Inconsistency</h3>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/12/opinion/12collins.html">recent column</a>, Gail Collins scoffs at Newt Gingrich’s latest incredulity, namely, his citing of his passionate commitment to his political agenda as an explanation for his serial adultery over the course of his two marriages that ended in divorce.</p>

<p>In Gingrich’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There’s no question that at times in my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked far too hard and that things happened in my life that were not appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Vanity Fair’s Bruce Handy <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/03/ten-observations-about-newt-gingrichs-adultery-rationale.html">went on to joke</a>, this is clearly a new view for Gingrich on the subject of marital indiscretion, given his rather different stance on the Lewinsky scandal that led to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. Now that Gingrich is himself planning a run for the presidency, he is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/newt-gingrich-rewrites-history-of-role-in-clinton-impeachment/2011/03/03/AF17PnoB_blog.html">attempting to rewrite the history</a> of his moralizing reaction to Clinton’s behavior during the 1998 midterm elections.</p>

<p>At issue is not the fact that—as subsequently came to light—during the Lewinsky-inspired impeachment trial he was shtupping a congressional aide in her 20s (now wife number three). Rather, the issue is that if he condemned Clinton then, and lets himself off the hook with the excuse of patriotism now, he’s going to be viewed as a hypocrite, i.e., a flip-flopper, which, as <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/29/politics/main646435.shtml">the Kerry campaign proved</a>, is the absolute number one way to lose an election—remember the ‘I voted for [the bill to appropriate funds for the Iraq war] before I voted against it’ debacle?</p>

<p>“Real” Americans—as Palin and other patriotic pols tell it—don’t change their minds. They are the people of the Constitution’s self-evident truths, the ones enshrined in a document we’ve put under bulletproof glass and for which we have prepared a blast-proof bunker in case of nuclear war. This emphasis on certainty and permanence dovetails nicely with an evangelical Christian attitude—if you hold the Constitution sacred in a way similar to how you revere the Bible (indeed, if you view the former as an outgrowth of the latter), naturally the idea that the Constitution is a document in flux and must be reinterpreted and amended comes as repugnant.</p>

<p>It is therefore easy to impugn people who want to debate and reframe these original concepts; it is easy to distain them for claiming to “know better.” This natural though problematic interpretation of an enthusiasm for public policy as a claim to intellectual superiority is exactly the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/0805073396">mindset the right-wing has exploited</a> in its successful harnessing of so-called elitism to government, and thereby fostering a distain for them both.</p>

<p>Where it matters most, then, Gingrich has been faithful, because it is far more important to be faithful to concepts than it is to people. This is why it is patriotic to propose resolving the deficit crisis on the backs of the poor and middle class—the <em>idea</em> of <em>America</em> being <em>destroyed by debt</em> is far worse than actual poor people whose day-to-day struggles you never see. A deep commitment to principles (again, something abstract) explains why a bunch of old white men can debate the reproductive rights of all women. And why, in the course of that debate, it is okay for Congressman Jon Kyl to state on the floor of the Senate that abortion services account for well over 90% of what Planned Parenthood does, and then later say, in a statement issued from his office, that those words “were not intended to be a factual statement.” How nice, but also how frightening, for Kyl to admit that he knew he was lying! (In fact, abortion constitutes about 3% of Planned Parenthood’s provided services. Oh, and there an existing mandate that no federal funds may finance abortion. Or that the deal that avoided a government shutdown included a provision making it illegal for the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/11/135317751/congresswoman-budget-bears-bad-news-for-nations-capital">District of Columbia</a> to use its own tax revenue for abortion services.)</p>

<p>Both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2011/04/12/135347030/jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-tweak-sen-kyl-on-planned-parenthood">had a field day with this one</a>, and of course we must have laughter between our tears. Sadly, though, Wyatt Cenac (in his satirical correspondent’s report on <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-april-11-2011/countdown-to-the-next-countdown---jon-kyl-lies-about-planned-parenthood">The Daily Show</a>) couldn’t be more descriptive of the current state of political discourse in his use of the term “lie facts” to describe Kyl’s inflammatory, statistical pants-on-fire-claim. Even worse, though, is the fact that to many people the explanation of the ‘ends justifying the means’ offered by Cenac wouldn’t sound ironic at all. “In his defense, he’s only lying about something that he believes in. It’s in service of a strongly-held moral principle.”</p>

  <p>Was really amazing to see Brad squirm under questioning. As soon as the woman took some control, he said “I can’t breathe”. Obviously he is OK only if he can be the total control freak. This show about concurrent polygamy is not authentic. —Comment left by dorianmodeo about <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20043169-10391698.html">the season finale of ABC’s <em>The Bachelor</em>, March 15, 2011</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brad Womack is a reality tv star, famous for his dual appearances on ABC’s <em>The Bachelor</em>. He has appeared twice because the first time around, he famously chose neither of his final two beauties. This time, it seems that his choice of single-mother Emily Maynard, to whom he proposed in the finale, <a href="http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-bachelor/the-bachelor-breakup-are-brad-40054.aspx">is already over</a>. (And I’m afraid that the irony of the phrase “intensely private couple” used by the post’s author, Meghan Carlson, is lost on her.)</p>

<p>This romance reality show falls midway on a spectrum ranging from ‘all show’ to ‘real life’. At the far end of this spectrum (all show), you find programs that take place separate and cut off from daily life. These include reality game shows where the contestants are removed from their normal lives to endure special circumstances, whether for money, fame, personal betterment, or some combination thereof (e.g., <em>Survivor</em>, <em>The Amazing Race</em>, <em>The Biggest Loser</em>). At the other end, we find situations where the cameras are invited in to a pre-existing situation to “follow” the subjects (<em>Jon and Kate plus 8</em>, <em>Real Life Housewives of [Wherever]</em>, <em>16 and Pregnant</em>). Naturally, these subjects remain changed by the shows—Jon and Kate got divorced, and both housewives and teen moms become tabloid targets—but they are only competing against the perniciousness of national attention, rather than other “contestants”.</p>

<p><em>The Bachelor</em> finds itself in the middle of this road in that it is a contestant-based program designed (ostensibly) to create an enduring status quo, namely, a lasting, monogamous relationship. It is not so much a post-modern dating show as a post-modern mating show: it puts a man or woman in the midst of a media-eager harem for the purpose of finding the protagonist a suitable marriage partner.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever seen the show, of course, is acquainted with the obvious hypocrisy, and even idiocy, with which this purported goal is pursued. I am reminded of the brilliant and crass anti-war slogan I saw during a march in the early days of the (second) Iraq war: “Bombing for Peace is like Fucking for Virginity.” <em>The Bachelor</em> uses similarly antithetical tactics to achieve its noble purpose. True love, marriage, and monogamy are planks in its platform, but the campaign consists of contrived adultery: a man (or woman) is supposed to find ‘the one’ by exploring, deepening, and expressing (with words and physical intimacy) these unique feelings for more than one contestant at once.</p>

<p>Anyone who won’t play this game—such a woman waiting for marriage to have sex—doesn’t stand of chance of winning it (as evidenced when Jake Pavelka rejected Corrie Adamson after her confession of her stance on this issue, which included no pre-nuptial co-habitation). The show pretends principles and engages our most moral fantasies of ‘happily ever after,’ but like most game shows, what it needs are players—and in this case, that includes women who are willing to be played. In short, it needs both its contestants and audience to believe in certain ends while suspending disbelief regarding the means to those ends.</p>

<h3 id="insincerity">Insincerity</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You have heard that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.” But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell. It was also said, “Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.” But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of infidelity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. —Matt. 5:27-32</p>

<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discipleship-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Vol/dp/0800683242"><em>Discipleship</em></a> [in German, <em>Nachfolge</em>, literally, coming after], does something rather radical. He makes a serious attempt to take Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount as a real how-to for a Christian life. Bonhoeffer demonstrates an amazing ability not to be dead-ended by the apparent either/or interpretational possibilities. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At this point, must we not decisively face the question of whether or not Jesus intended his command to be taken literally or merely figuratively? … Our own will advises us to flee from this decision, which appears to be so deadly serious. But the question itself is wrong and evil. It cannot be answered. If we were to say that, of course, the command is not meant to be taken literally, then we would already have dodged the seriousness of the command. But if we were to say, of course, it should be taken literally, this would only show that Christian existence is absurd on principle, and the command would lose its authority. It is precisely the fact that, for us, this basic question is not answered that binds us so completed to Jesus’ command. Neither option offers us an escape. —Discipleship, <em>Chapter 6: The Sermon on the Mount</em>, “Woman” (p. 126)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way out that Jesus offers, Bonhoeffer explains, is captured by contrast between the imposition of the law (the Commandments) and the mercy of the gospel. And as the gospel is a gospel of love, Jesus’ words on adultery speak to preservation of the integrity of faith, rather than as a denial of the body and its desires. Bonhoeffer writes: “Jesus does not disapprove of the body and its natural desires. But he rejects the lack of faith that is concealed in it.” Thus at root in the prohibition against adultery is really an admonition against infidelity in a much greater sense, both within and without marriage, both in and out of bed.</p>

<p>As marriage under religion is a union designed to sanctify the connection between two people via their individual unions to God, it becomes a natural synecdoche for an individual’s sincerity, one’s personal faith. Faith can only be understood as a totality, and thus the debate over the location of adultery (or sin in general) in this deed or that word or that thought is just as senseless in this context as the directive to cut off one’s hand or take out one’s eye—indeed, the senseless of the latter reveals Jesus’ lack of interest in a literal interpretation.</p>

<p>Bonhoeffer concludes his book:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The follower [Nachfolger] of Jesus is the imitator [Nachahmer] of God. “Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children” (Eph. 5:1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No image could better express the loving nature of faith, and its emphasis on closeness to God, rather than division. Society has thrown stones or had letters sewn for women who have been “unfaithful,” all the while missing the point that the far greater danger is to be empty of faith. Faith that, like children, we are needy, deserving, and able to love ourselves so that, as the psalm goes, our cups runneth over.</p>

<p>As a friend of mind recently said, “Never is just tomorrow’s lunch.” For those who thought that K-12 public school teaching would forever remain a generally ignored profession in this country, lunch is now on the table. While long relegated to the classic ‘women’s career’ trifecta of nurse-secretary-teacher, it seems that suddenly everyone has woken up extremely concerned that many of the molders of America’s young minds are not up to snuff. Unfortunately, this concern about attracting the best and brightest to the field of education has not led to a rapid rise in teacher salaries (as it has done for the <a href="http://www.epi.org/economic_snapshots/entry/webfeatures_snapshots_20060627/">skyrocketing compensation of American CEOs in recent decades</a>. Rather, it has led to a rather shocking public scapegoating in which the ineffective teacher is maligned as a malevolent succubus on the body public (school).</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>The (lost) battle in Wisconsin over the right of state employees to collectively bargain is in one way the continuation of this larger and longer discussion about the quality of public education in this country. For many years now—certainly since the passage of George Bush 43’s “No Child Left Behind” bill in 2001—many critics of the status quo have advocated that the most effective way to improve the quality of public education is to identify effective and ineffective teachers, rewarding the former while eliminating the latter. In order to do this, the long-standing (union) policies that provide job security for many public school teachers need to be altered or done away with entirely.</p>

<p>At first blush, this kind of performance- and incentive-based scheme seems like a wonderful idea. (Never mind the fact that extremely high-paid finance industry folks brought down the economy three years ago!) Almost everyone can recall the benefits she received from a particularly caring or talented teacher. In some cases, our early teachers inspire in us a love for a subject that becomes a life’s work (whether remunerated or not).</p>

<p>The problem with this concept is where one might expect it—in the details. What does it mean for a teacher to be effective, and how exactly do you measure it?</p>

<p>In the realm of K-12 education, standardized testing, which has been for ages the standard yardstick of student performance (or of learning, if you will), is now being recast as the measure of teacher performance (or of teaching effectiveness). This shift has prompted teachers to “teach to the test”—meaning, to teach not in a way they think is best, but in a way that can demonstrate (immediately) that they are effective. Thus the incentive of curricular autonomy, of using one’s own judgment, has been replaced by the disincentive of losing one’s job if the kids don’t make the grade.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, good teaching does not always lead to learning in the case of each individual student, not only in general, but specifically as measured on a standardized test taken in a specific moment in time. This is because there are many variables that effect student learning, from innate intelligence, personal interest and motivation, home environment, and—though we rarely talk about it—the professional chemistry between student and teacher. (And no I did not get <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/opinion/08brooks.html">this idea from David Brooks</a>—I’m just generally cursed with thinking the same thing at the same time someone much more famous is thinking it.) Not to mention the often cavalier attitude of students toward standardized tests. I recall having to retake some state exam by myself, because I had been absent the day it was given, and I got so bored at the end that I just filled in bubbles at random so I could go to lunch.</p>

<p>To return to my argument, we have all had teachers whom we loved, as well as those we have… well, not loved. Every student and every teacher is unique, and there is no way to ensure that every student will always have the most well-matched teacher for her learning style or personal preference. As in cooking, the best ingredients and recipe don’t always ensure a tasty dinner. This is just the entropy and unpredictability of what we call real life.</p>

<h3 id="popularity">Popularity</h3>
<p>In the realms of higher education,  professor performance is being increasingly determined by student evaluations—both official and unofficial. On an official level, the surveys that students fill out at the end of a term about the course and their professor are being given more and more weight in hiring, firing, and (supposedly) tenure decisions. Similar to the backlash against unionized K-12 teachers who keep their jobs (or their pay) even after being labeled ineffective or worse (see this <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/31/090831fa_fact_brill?yrail">stunning article in <em>The New Yorker</em></a> about the termination process in New York City), recently there has been an outcry against elite (read: liberal), tenured professors who are paid a great deal of money to do very little teaching, and not necessarily any of it well or with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>While the experience of a course with such a professor is inarguably demoralizing—and anyone who has taken a Bachelor’s degree at a major research university has almost certainly had this experience (ah, Apuleius!)—the transformation of the University into University, Inc. (meaning, from an institution of higher learning to a service industry of diploma issuance) has not been all roses and butterflies. Indeed, arguably it has hardly impacted the targets of the main outcry, as there is no indication that established, valuable professors (meaning those who are famous, or who bring in money, or both) are being denied tenure or fired because of low evaluations.</p>

<p>Instead, universities are cutting way back on tenure regardless of its relation to teaching effectiveness, something they can afford to do given the superabundance of PhDs in the current job market. Thus the brunt of the reward-for-performance emphasis on teaching is falling onto those least shielded by the institutional protections of long-term contracts and tenure. (The latest <a href="http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/survey_coalition/repview_coalition">Survey by the Coalition on the Academic Workforce</a> reports that “full-time tenure-track faculty members taught less than half of the introductory undergraduate courses in all but two of the disciplines” surveyed. <a href="http://www.mla.org/files/coalition_table2.htm">See table</a>.) While elite institutions may be selling students on the institution’s responsiveness to their evaluations, the bottom line that usually counts is not who is best, but who is cheapest.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the increasing availability of instructor evaluations to all students at a given university has turned course selection into a popularity contest. While there is some truth to the expression “forewarned is forearmed,” there are arguably some distinct disadvantages to letting the previous experience of other students influence your choice on whether to take a certain course. For one, <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/deep-in-the-heart-of-texas/">as Stanley Fish has argued</a>, students may not be in the best position to evaluate a teacher or course’s effectiveness at the end of a term—or even by the end of college. Second, there is simply no accounting for taste. <em>De gustibus non est disputandum</em>. Third, there is a learning curve in teaching, and this goes double for teachers who are just starting their post-graduate teaching careers. With fewer and fewer recent PhDs finding a long-term or tenure track position upon graduation, it becomes increasingly difficult to gather momentum—including stunning evaluations—that may be necessary for a continuing career.</p>

<p>The consideration of other people’s opinions—and the tendency to treat them as predictive of one’s own experience—is the devil in the detailed-data world in which we now live. While the millenials will have to take our word on this, the rest of us who used to read (literally) the newspaper can tell you that it is an entirely different experience from reading the same content online. Years ago now, I remarked with chagrin that my experience of my preferred daily, the <em>New York Times</em>, had deteriorated significantly now that I rarely read the print edition. And why was this? Because with the physical paper I scanned the pages for articles that caught my interest, whereas on the website, I usually just scrolled down the list of the most popular articles and read a smattering of those. <em>And even though I knew that this was impoverishing my experience</em> (a number of times my mother, who reads the print edition faithfully, would point out an article of interest that I hadn’t noticed), I rarely bothered (except on Sundays) to browse the website in the way I did the paper version.</p>

<p>For better and for worse, it comes as second nature to today’s students to share their opinions, usually in the moment they have them. Where they get their information—the Internet—is also the forum that encourages them to add their own. It requires hardly any effort to “like” something on Facebook or write a comment on a newspaper story or blog. On screen, somehow, the text of the article seems equal to all other texts; the original context (the newspaper itself) has vanished, and along with it, an important reminded of the methods of its production, especially the generous ratio of time, thought, and research expended per word written that is the hallmark of good journalism.</p>

<p>Similarly, buttressed by the safety of anonymity and tempted by the all-to-human urge to gossip, students are now drawn to look at and contribute to websites that allow anyone to comment on a professor’s competence, style, and of course, looks. In this appearance-obsessed and comment-driven culture, what (and who) is liked in the academy becomes what is highly rated. This is unfortunate for every professor who, by unfamiliarity with the student body, temperament, teaching style, looks, or what have you, is not immediately likable—and immediately is the key term here, because nowadays it is first reactions, and not reflections that matter.</p>

<p>We see this everyday in the blogosphere, which then tends to influence the (formerly?) mainstream media. A prime recent example is the video made of NPR fund-raiser Ron Schiller at the initiative of political activist James O’Keefe that led to Schiller’s hastened departure (he had already announced he was leaving) from NPR. The <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/03/14/134525412/Segments-Of-NPR-Gotcha-Video-Taken-Out-Of-Context">follow-up coverage</a> (including viewing and analysis of the raw video footage of the two-hour lunch between Schiller and the two men posing as representatives of a Muslim organization) revealed, however, that Schiller had done an excellent job of explaining that no donor to NPR could buy coverage, given the firewall that existed between development and the newsroom. Nevertheless, the mere suggestion of any impropriety was enough to prompt not only Ron Schiller’s hastened departure and his reneging on his next post at the Aspen Institute but also the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/10/134388981/npr-ceo-vivian-schiller-resigns">resignation of the CEO of NPR, Vivienne Schiller</a> (no relation).</p>

<p>While arguably these resignations were pragmatic—given the intense scrutiny of NPR by Republicans who are somehow convinced that any media organization that receives government funding must be a bastion of socialist thought—they were not logical. Nor do they stand in the long term to benefit either NPR or the general media culture. Our notions of what constitutes honesty and disclosure have become distorted if we are ready to believe that two posers hired by a man with no commitment to journalistic objectivity can spend two hours misrepresenting themselves and somehow expose—via a heavily and deliberately edited videotape of events—the â€˜hypocrisy’ of Ron Schiller. This situation suggests that the roles of appearance and reality have undergone a radical reversal in our culture. He who misrepresents himself for a â€˜cause’ is the truth-bearer, while he who speaks honestly (though not perfectly), in the assumption of privacy, is a hypocrite. Context is powerless against the pernicious temptation to take everything at face value—and how else do we have time to take anything, if we are bombarded by media rocket fire 24/7?</p>

<h3 id="complaint-culture">Complaint Culture</h3>
<p>Essentially, the problem with telling someone over and over that her opinion matters (What’s on your mind? asks the mindless Facebook) is that she may eventually forget that opinions are better off carefully weighed, and perhaps not voiced at all in certain contexts. (Glenn Beck is a really good example of someone who <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-03-14/news/29147017_1_glenn-beck-natural-disasters-health-care-bill#ixzz1GcmjUU9H">just can’t help himself</a>, and who has been keenly rewarded for his blowhardery with fame and fortune.)</p>

<p>In the realm of education, complaint culture has many potential dangers. Unjustified student griping via evaluations may unfairly lead to the dismissal of a good teacher, but so can the <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/facebook_vent_burns_teacher_JiHBB6wQwDljiYVfcUiIpN#ixzz1GXquxvdS">unfortunate expression of a teacher’s frustrations lead to her firing</a>. Reading this rather shocking example of this Facebook episode, one is prompted to roll one’s eyes and wonder how this teacher could have been so careless as to post something so inflammatory in a (for all purposes, if not intents) public forum. However, we should not kid ourselves that students (or rather, the clients) at University (Inc.) are acting with any greater level of reflection—as they are more insulated by their status as â€˜paying customers’, if anything, they are acting with less.</p>

<p>Of course it is unpleasant that Ms. Rubino put into unfortunate words her frustrations about her fifth graders. But such frustrations aren’t new; Facebook didn’t create them, it just made them public. What Facebook does do is put us face to face with them, and so we suddenly feel that we have to “do” something about the situation—even if logically we know that Ms. Rubino’s having felt (or even expressed) that emotion does not make her (objectively) a worse teacher. Similarly, students have always disliked some of their courses and their professors. They just haven’t always been empowered with the notion that their dislike entitles them to pass judgment on that professor’s retention.</p>

<p>This notion that we must be always and immediately satisfied in our culture seems to be leading to the ever-quickening pace of judgment, but all this judgment—or rather venting—seems to be impoverishing the public sphere rather than enriching it. It is true that you have a right to your opinion, and free speech is great. But just as often, the profligate expression of our thoughts comes at a price.</p>

<p>This sad event is not the only tie-in between the treatment of women—specifically the maltreatment of women—and revolution. The raped woman has historically served as a poignant metaphor for an oppressed country. Just last week, Roberto Benigni made reference to Italy as “un corpo dilaniato, posseduto, stuprato, violentato, saccheggiato, il corpo più bello del mondo… saccheggiato, proprio per quello” in his beautiful exegesis of the Italian national anthem. That is, “a body torn apart, possessed, assaulted, raped, sacked, the most beautiful body in the world… sacked precisely because of [its beauty].” While the world <em>corpo</em> is masculine, it is obvious to all that this is the beautiful body of the woman <em>Italia</em>. (<em>La patria</em>, the fatherland, is feminine in Italian.)</p>

<p>The spark that lit these revolutionary fires also is connected to the performance of female victimhood.  As has been widely reported, what triggered the initial uprising in Tunisia was the self-immolation of a 26-yr.-old fruit seller named Mohammed Bouazizi. The setting of oneself on fire is a gruesome act, and is not particularly culturally intelligible in the West. (Here’s a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043123,00.html">history in TIME magazine</a>.)</p>

<p>But just months ago the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/world/asia/08burn.html"><em>The New York Times</em> ran a story</a> on this practice among Afghan women. Here is the first paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even the poorest families in Afghanistan have matches and cooking fuel. The combination usually sustains life. But it also can be the makings of a horrifying escape: from poverty, from forced marriages, from the abuse and despondency that can be the fate of Afghan women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Tunisia is not Afganistan, and the gasoline Bouazizi used is not cooking oil, the frustration and desperation he felt by being denied even the right to make a meager living as a fruit seller seems a fair enough comparison to the subjugation of a Afghan bride. The comparison gets even more interesting if we consider the following detail from the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/02/20/60minutes/main20033404.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody">60 Minutes story on Bouazizi</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A municipal official, a woman, came by and confiscated his scale. It was worth $100 and Bouazizi knew he’d have to pay a bribe to get it back. This had happened to him before. But this time, he got mad. He complained and the woman slapped him. One slap in the face, and that’s how the revolution began.<br />
While we cannot know that things would have gone differently had it been a man to take away his scale, or a man to slap him, we do know that his act of self-immolation gripped the imaginations of his fellow-country men.<br />
“The symbol by just burning himself, using his body as a way to express that anger and need for dignity touched a lot of Tunisians,” Zied Mhirsi told “60 Minutes” correspondent Bob Simon.<br />
Mhirsi is a doctor and radio show host who was active in the uprising. He worked with us on our story. 
“Do you think this revolution would have happened now if it hadn’t been for Bouazizi?” Simon asked.<br />
“I don’t think so,” Mhirsi replied, shaking his head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, Bouazizi’s act prompted not only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/world/africa/18egypt.html">other self-immolations</a>, but also protests, which eventually swelled and spread, giving us the smorgasbord of (relatively) peaceful change (Egypt) and violent unrest (Libya) we see before us today. Bouazizi’s act epitomized a powerlessness infused with action, with resolve, even if that resolve was self-destructive. This powerlessness clearly resonated with his compatriots, and went on to capture the imagination of frustrated citizens all over the region.</p>

<p>And this is where the analogy with the Afghan women ends. Bouazizi’s act did not confirm his position of powerlessness in a culture that condoned it and that was designed to perpetuate it. Rather, it provoked the majority in agreement with Bouazizi to act against the government whose policies wanted to deny him (and many like him) a living. And so his act galvanized them, forced them to look at and acknowledge their own humiliation and take action. It was not an escape, it was a call to arms.</p>

<p>In this sense, shame is a critical component to these revolutions. While I would never excuse those who raped Lara Logan in Tahrir Square, it is rule of thumb that people excise their own sense of powerlessness by finding someone else to hold power over. And you cannot cry out for freedom without the acknowledgement that you have been—and for a very long time, in many of these countries—kept down. Sadly, many people cannot rid themselves of the embarrassment of what they have endured, so patiently and so silently, without transferring your status of victim to someone still less powerful than yourself. In this way, Lara Logan, a female reporter with great deal of autonomy and fame (including a lot of talk about her sex life), symbolized the power that her attackers wanted and had felt denied by their own governments. In short, they turned their symbolic, feminized subjugation around by physically violating an actual woman. Even in the 21st century, this oldest of tropes is still played out every day. We would be naive to think it is not so.</p>

<p>Let us hope that the new governments that are formed in the Middle East and North Africa empower all citizens in such a way to promote the equal rights of women. Despite the documented inequalities that still exist within the United States between men and women, particularly in salary and in employment opportunities, when compared with the status quo in many, many other places, (most) women in this country are extremely blessed.</p>

<p>Certainly I feel ambivalent about wanting to thank the men of the United States who treat women with respect—it feels odd to express gratitude for the granting of a basic human right. Except that this is how all human rights are granted, by each individual human granting them to other human beings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, sex and revolution continue arm in arm. You tell me what the dancers flanking Qaddafi are there for in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBY-0n4esNY">this YouTube mash-up of the mad leader’s speech</a>, which will certainly go even more viral than it already has, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/world/middleeast/28youtube.html?">thanks to the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>

          <!-- <p>Have you ever paused to consider the ways and means of human emotions, the contours of the banks in whose beds they run, ever meandering and flowing? Lately I have found myself wondering about the meaning of repugnance, an emotion we all feel, even if we don’t confess to it openly, or even to ourselves.

          <p>Have you ever paused to consider the ways and means of human emotions, the contours of the banks in whose beds they run, ever meandering and flowing? Lately I have found myself wondering about the meaning of repugnance, an emotion we all feel, even if we don’t confess to it openly, or even to ourselves. Repugnance, in its purest form, is a several times removed from hatred, or fear, two emotions whose ancestral roots are in ignorance. Repugnance is more visceral, prompted by the conviction of intimacy rather than the prejudice of otherness. Often what repulses us does so, I think, because it is close to us in some way, either by belief or by experience—and in some cases the former can be so strong as to override the absence of the latter.</p>

<p>An example. I am pro-choice: I believe that each woman has the right to control her reproductivity, including through the use of abortion to terminate unwanted pregnancies. This does not mean, however, that I don’t find the use of abortion as casual birth control to be repugnant. Recently, <em>The New York Times</em> reported on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/nyregion/04abortion.html">very high rate of abortion in New York City</a>. The reporter spoke to a young woman at Planned Parenthood’s Margaret Sanger Center in Greenwich Village:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 17-year-old girl there to pick up a friend said she had had an abortion in May. It was her second; the first was when she was 15. The girl said she sometimes used condoms. “But I wasn’t using them when I got pregnant,” she said. “I might use them more now, but I don’t know.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even as a die-hard liberal, I find her attitude sad and offensive. This is an understandable reason why people want to outlaw abortion, because of young women who take unwanted pregnancies so cavalierly and treat abortion as a causal form of birth control, a practical alternative to condom use. I find this view repugnant; it is immature, irresponsible, and wasteful (of time, human resources, and money). Not to mention the fact that I find it difficult to understand why any woman would want to go through the physical trauma of pregnancy termination willy-nilly.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding women like these, I believe the right and access to abortion should remain open, and, for women of limited means, free. (Birth control should be free, too, of course.) Abortion must be legally and easily available simply because there are too many other women, and too many other reasons, why women—including responsible women who have children or want to have a(nother) child—seek to end pregnancies. It is simplistic to reduce all abortions to a callous disregard for human life, or a (selfish) unwillingness to be a parent. The casting of abortion as a moral crime with no gray zone is a prime example of belief overcoming experience in the generation of repugnance. Belief often has the convenience of simplicity, but experience is always more complex.</p>

<p>It is a democratic principle that one must allow people to do things that one finds disagreeable, offensive, and even extremely morally repugnant. This is the meaning of the motto ‘live and let live’. It doesn’t say, ‘live and let live the way I think is right’. While the Republicans may not want to introduce Sharia law, they resemble those radical Islamists in their desire to impose their moral values on everyone else—and the ease with which they justify this desire through recourse to the divine origin of their moral codes.</p>

<p>It is quite contradictory that many on the right wing of the political spectrum—the side that claims to espouse personal liberty—also seem to forget that personal liberty is not equivalent to the freedom to act in the way they deem appropriate. ‘Don’t tread on me’ indeed, says the Tea Party, but they do not advocate for gay marriage or a positive right to abortion.</p>

<p>Non-libertarian conservatives (including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/us/politics/13tea.html">some but not all Tea Partiers</a>) have confused the politics of personal liberty with the politics of repugnance, when the former requires precisely the willing tolerance of what one finds repugnant. Thomas Jefferson, who acted on behalf of Virginia’s Baptists in 1776 to defend their right to practice their religion, admitted his disagreement with their beliefs. Stephen Marini, Historian of Religion, Wellesley College, puts it this way in Part Two of PBS’s fascinating series <a href="http://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/transcripts/hour-two.html">God in America</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jefferson says, “I couldn’t disagree with you more about the substance of all of this. But I will defend your right to say it.” And that’s exactly what he does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jefferson (who edited his own Bible—talk about take what you like and leave the rest!) understood that the issue was not one of moral approval, but of legal permission, and he was willing to fight for someone else’s right to do something with which he disagreed.</p>

<p>How far we have come from this, it seems, in our obsession over homosexual marriage, for example. How intolerant and even fearful we have become of people who do not live the way we do. Yet I am not interested in changing the minds of people who are repulsed or horrified by gay marriage. I only wish they were Jefferson-minded enough to separate their politics from their feelings.</p>

<p>Though people with feelings draft laws, laws are not merely about feelings. If that were true, the Constitution could never be seen as it is today, namely as a guarantee of the rights of citizens other than propertied white males. It was and remains the willingness to disregard the original feelings of the people who wrote the Constitution, to see it in another light, that makes it a valuable and viable charter of governance.</p>

<p>The Republicans are a bit schizophrenic on this issue, too. One the one hand, they prefer strict constructionist judges on the Supreme Court, i.e., those who keep the framer’s intentions in mind, in order that ‘new’ rights (such as the right to abortion) are not ‘discovered’ in the document. However, at the beginning of the 112th Congress, they preferred not to read aloud the Constitution as those very same men wrote it, deeming (not inaccurately) that it would not be such a keen idea to read into the record, patriotic chests a-puff, the definition of a slave (read: black person) as three-fifths of a person. Take what you like and leave the rest… off the record.</p>

<p>Republicans love freedom, but as an adulterous man loves his wife: he shows up with her in public when only when necessary, not out of true fidelity. These convenient appearances include the use of freedom as a buzz word for unfettered capitalism (your personal liberty equals the rights of rich people not to pay high taxes—see Frank Thomas’s piece in <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2011/03/0083329">March’s Harpers</a> and occasions where perpetuating ignorance is useful (my correcting your ignorance about Obama’s religion or birthplace is an infringement on your personal liberty, so I’ll let laissez-faire rule the day—see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYEqCyYZ0FE">John Boehner’s statement on <em>Meet the Press</em></a>.</p>

<p>How does ignorance become a liberty worth protecting while reproductive choice remains under attack? The politics of repugnance, that’s how. Otherwise known as the politics of self-serving hypocrisy, which is not really politics at all.</p>

          <p>In tragic opera, when you fall in love, it is forever. There will be no getting over it, no moving on, and no satisfaction, either. Therefore the only possible rival—or alternative—to such love is a higher principle or virtue.</p>

<p>In the case of the star-crossed lovers Don Carlo and his lovely Elisabetta—his once-bethrothed who ends up his mother (the Church doesn’t really acknowledge a “step” relationship the way we might) when his father, King Filippo, takes the French princess for himself—their respective higher principles are that of piety and liberty, or, abstractly put, the ying-yang virtues of bondage and freedom.</p>

<p>Having been asked to assent to the marriage in order to bring peace to her people (ending the war between France and Spain), Elisabetta feels it is her duty to accept as the will of God her role as Queen of Spain and mother to the man she loves in a non-filial way. Heartsick and homesick, she nonetheless remains dutiful and pious; although she does not love her husband, she refuses to sully her own name, or his, with the stain of adultery. (As it turns out, it is the King himself who strays, seducing the beautiful Princess Eboli, who out of jealousy of Carlo’s love for Elisabetta, accuses her of infidelity.)</p>

<p>For Carlo, it is his best friend the Marquis (and later Duke) di Posa, Rodrigo, who fans the flames of his long-standing commitment to the cause of liberty, specifically that of the Flemish people, who are currently being oppressed by Spanish rule. Even when Rodrigo becomes the King’s main counselor, he never wavers in his love for his brother-in-arms Carlo, and he dies in his place by taking from him compromising papers of Carlo’s involvement in the Flemish rebellion.</p>

<p>The brilliance of Verdi’s opera is its exploration of the crumbling of the very foundations of these apparently stark and solid principles. References to God, heaven, the vanities of the world and the peaceful repose of death abound, and even the lightest of directorial touches cannot help but hammer home the contraction between devotion to a loving, merciful God, the peace of heaven and the human cruelties of the Inquisition. If the general context of celebration, complete with royal appearance, as heretics are led to burn at the stake in an auto-da-fÃ© weren’t symbolic enough, the elderly and stern Grand Inquisitor himself is blind.</p>

<p>Filippo himself is pained by the inadequacies of his power as sovereign. Estranged from his son for both political and emotional reasons, and saddened by the awareness that his wife never loved him, the only consolation he finds is in the loyalty of his confidant Rodrigo, who for one is not truly his, dying in the end in place of Carlo and their cause of Flemish liberty, and whom the Inquisitor scorns when he visits Filippo, asking him why he is called King if there is a man equal to him. This in the same scene in which the King asks if he will be forgiven if he signs the death warrant on his own son. (The justification the Inquisitor gives when Filippo asks whether, as a Christian, he can kill his son, is that God sacrificed his Son, too, an answer that satisfies neither Filippo nor the audience, who in the auto-da-fÃ© has seen Christ’s suffering equated to the burning of heretics.) Simply put, neither Church nor Crown are happy institutions in this opera, begging the question exactly for what everyone’s duty and obeisance are good for, if the King is lonely and the Inquisitor is blind to the love supposedly at the heart of the religion he serves.</p>

<p>In their final hour alone, Elisabetta convinces Carlo not to let his broken heart destroy him, but to go, as he promised Rodrigo, to lead the Flemish to freedom. They bid their adieus as mother and son, promising to meet again in Heaven. But it is the dull mystery of unheroic death that steals the opera’s final scene: the Inquisitor’s guards slay the prince, and the monk of the cloister, who all recognize by his voice as the ghost of Carlo V, Filippo’s father and Carlo’s grandfather (and namesake), appears to announce, for the final time, that the true war is in the human heart, and is only calmed by death. (N.B. The libretto calls for the Monk to drag Carlo’s body into the tomb, but the recent (2010-11 season) Met staging let the curtain fall with him dead in Elizabetta’s arms.)</p>

<p>For the modern watcher, and even for that of Verdi’s day, the accusations of cruelty and heartlessness, of misguidedness and inadequacy, toward the Spanish Church and the Crown are hardly shocking. Our distance gives us not greater wisdom, merely more evidence with which we can confirm that the perils of violence and misgovernment are hardly limited to the Inquisition and the institution of monarchy. This added perspective of time does not lessen the level of feeling, or the impact of this tragic work. Indeed, it provokes us to wonder what principles and institutions of our current era later artists will enshrine in stage and song, shaking their head at our own faults and blindness.</p>

<p>In a world now abuzz with the threat of media overwhelm, silence (or relative silence) still reigns in certain places.

<p>It was no wonder that the underprivileged children they saw at their preschool could not catch up and often lagged behind once they went to school. They simply weren’t getting the experience with language provided to their peers.</p>

<p>One is tempted to wonder whether it is fair to call language a privilege, whether this is not a form of presumption, perhaps the ultimate presumption of a certain strata of society that some label—with disdain— “elite.” If the right to procreate is unalienable—and surely it has to be one of the most fundamental of those in the “life and liberty” category—then it must also be part of that right to raise those children in whatever (or almost whatever) manner one sees fit. Even from my seat on the left of the political smorgasbord, the idea of instructing low-income mothers on how to increase linguistic interaction by critiquing videotaped moments with their children does seem a bit nanny-state-ish. Sadly, these efforts don’t do bleeding-heart liberals any favors. They are the equivalent of restoring the beach with buckets of sand, instead of addressing the real issue—ocean tides. Such interventions smack of condescension and, worse yet, merely throw a pop-psychology bone at the dog of poverty. The true root of perpetual poverty, in addition to underpaid and overworked parents, is the lack of a genuine commitment in this country to quality, equal-opportunity health care, child care, and education. (Oh, and the increasing consolidation of our national wealth in the hands of an ever-diminishing few.)</p>

<p>Today’s liberals have lost the way if it has become acceptable to promote the idea that poverty is somehow cultural, and can be counteracted by what amounts, frankly, to teaching poor parents to mimic the cultural status markers of chatty, hovering, anxious (white) parents preoccupied with their offspring’s achievement. The American Dream, and its melting pot, used to work its magic in precisely the opposite way. It used to take children of all backgrounds and cultures, and give them—through rigorous, free and equal-opportunity education—the bonds of common knowledge and shared worldliness, which is a culture all to itself. If this sounds naive now, it is because it is naive now, given that we as a nation can no longer agree on what our children should be learning, or what views about the world they should share. Moreover, even “Hollywood liberals” such as Robert De Niro now freely acknowledge (at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards) that an actor’s best hope for his children that “the movies do well enough so you can keep them in private schools.” This after <em>Glee</em> writer Ian Brennan offered a shout-out to public school teachers: “You  don’t get paid like it, but you are doing the most important work in  America.”</p>

  <p>Secondly, my hope—is for you to be literate! If you’re literate in English grammar, then you comprehend English grammar.

</blockquote>

<p>There are many reasons to be disappointed in our elected officials, and while arguably most reasonable people would not think that their believing in the validity of the U.S. Constitution would make them “stupid and unintelligent”—as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09shooter.html">Jared Lee Loughner apparently remarked about Gabrielle Giffords</a>, after speaking to her at a public event in 2007—these same reasonable people would very likely agree that Loughner is more than entitled to his opinion.</p>

<p>The problem, however, is that he is also entitled to lethal weapons, weapons whose deadliness he fetishized in pornographic images of himself and his Glock. (Rhymes with….) Images that he intended to be found after his own assassination, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/us/16loughner.html?pagewanted=7">dropping the film off to be developed at a Walgreens</a> the night before the attack at the Safeway.</p>

<p>While Loughner’s views will seem laughably fringe or outright crazy to many, if not most, the patent acceptance and/or rabid attachment to the Second Amendment remains, even in the wake of the Tuscon “tragedy,” the unquestionable status quo in this country. Even if we woke up tomorrow with a functional mental health system in this country, the only way to prevent Loughner or someone with his same intent from easily getting a Glock will be to prevent everyone from easily getting a Glock. I don’t know why the majority of people in this country aren’t ready to go without their “right” to a Glock in order to deprive Loughner of his… or maybe they are, but the majority’s voice isn’t being heard.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m not holding my breath for Congresswoman Giffords to change her opinion on gun control. Guns don’t kill people, crazy people kill people, and there’s nothing you can do about that, like accidents on the highway. We will mourn the dead and shake our heads, but in the end we prefer the narrative of the marvelous medical heroics that have saved Gifford’s life, the “miracle” of her survival, over a serious reconsideration of the banal realities (principally among them, easy access to guns) that led to the attack that left her injured and six other people dead, including a nine-year-old girl with a budding interest in government. Born on a terribly dark day for America’s foreign policy, 9.11.2001, Christina-Taylor Green died the victim of America’s greatest domestic scourge—the combination of virulent (even paranoid) dissent and access to weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>I agree that he was mentally disturbed, but Jared Lee Loughner was not running in circles, he was not merely held hostage to his paranoia. He had a violent plan and he was lucid enough to interact normally with an officer of the law at a traffic stop the very morning of the attack. There was no probable cause to warrant a search of his car, whose trunk held the paraphernalia of his planned trouble. Loughner got a lot of constitutional benefits: free speech, unimpaired access to arms, and the protection against unwarranted search and seizure. One is hard pressed to understand why the Reconstruction amendments (the so-called ‘ratifications’) and the issue of a gold-backed currency bothered him so much. Even if you are content to call Loughner crazy, know that plenty of not mentally disturbed people are bothered by these and other issues that are equally inscrutable—the birther movement, to mention just one. Have you listened to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Scvqylprc">birther in the Congressional visitor’s gallery</a> interrupting the reading of Article 2, section 1 (regarding citizenship requirements for the President) and calling for Jesus’s help?</p>

<h3 id="blood-libel">Blood, Libel</h3>
<p>Leave it to Sarah Palin to unveil the Jewish angle of the Tuscon attack. Although not much has been made of it, Giffords, Loughner’s prime target, is Jewish. I have no idea whether Loughner knew this, but arguably Sarah Palin—or whoever wrote her speech—did know this, and the same certainly knew the meaning of the term “blood libel.”</p>

<p>The term refers to historical lies about Jews, including their responsibility for the murder of Jesus, that have justified their hatred and persecution. The word <em>libel</em> reflects the falsehood of such accusations (from a historical perspective), while the term <em>blood</em> recalls the brutality of the crimes of which the Jews were falsely accused. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb0VW8vnMhQ">Sarah Palin</a> uses the term to defend herself against the accusation that she, through her rhetoric, is responsible for the bloodshed in Tuscon. Cleverly, she has placed herself in the position of the victim—she is the one persecuted falsely, she is the Jew who has been unfairly accused of murdering Christ.</p>

<p>The flammability of this remark in the mouth of a woman who makes so much of her Christian faith cannot be underestimated. Indeed, her entire speech is a catechism in a subtle recasting of the events in Tuscon in religious terms—from her opening line about the death of innocents, her reflection on the beautiful Catholic mass held in honor of the victims, and her insertion that “in times like these, we need God’s guidance, and the peace He provides” in the face of the “evil” witnessed in Tuscon.</p>

<p>Politics, in Sarah Palin’s view, has always been more nasty than nice—”if men and women were angels, there would be no need for government.” In other words, it is an activity of a fallen world, and thus appropriately heated and (perhaps) inevitably violent, even if these days the violence is dismissed as “random acts of a criminal.”</p>

<p>Palin instead is confident that Giffords knew, when she read aloud the First Amendment of “our sacred charter of liberty” on the first day of the 112th Congress, that she was engaged in an act that was more than “just symbolic.”</p>

<p>Never mind that the version of the Constitution read was not the original document, omitting the parts with which we have yet to come to terms as having been a part of our history. The parts, it may be observed, that were redressed by the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

Recently, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/133094306/novelist-professor-reynolds-price-dies">NPR introduced me to Reynolds Price</a>, a well known Duke professor and novelist.</p> <p>While learning about someone interesting after you can no longer meet him or her might provoke a certain sadness among those predisposed to nostalgia, personally I lean more toward a practical analysis, and am grateful to the genre of the obituary, given that I figure I would have likely never met the person in question anyway. Obituaries, like memory itself, distill us into our purest essence, our most portable, teachable moments.

          <p>I don’t know many people who have died, but hardly a week goes by when I don’t meet someone new through his or her obituary. Recently, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/133094306/novelist-professor-reynolds-price-dies">NPR introduced me to Reynolds Price</a>, a well known Duke professor and novelist.</p>

<p>While learning about someone interesting after you can no longer meet him or her might provoke a certain sadness among those predisposed to nostalgia, personally I lean more toward a practical analysis, and am grateful to the genre of the obituary, given that I figure I would have likely never met the person in question anyway. Obituaries, like memory itself, distill us into our purest essence, our most portable, teachable moments. And so I smiled to hear Price’s maxim on the radio that morning: “You’ll only regret your economies,” advice he had received while in Oxford from his thesis examiner and English professor, Nevill Coghill, who had received it from his mother on her deathbed.</p>

<h3 id="late-learners">Late learners</h3>
<p>My mother reads the obituaries without fail in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> – our household paper of choice, which my retired father must read before my mother absconds with it on her commute. This, along with a patience for the sports pages which is clearly not genetically transmissible, clearly accounts for her immense knowledge of recent history and related arcana (details of our last match of Trivial Pursuit have been sealed to protect egos).</p>

<p>Indeed, it was only thanks to this habit of hers that I found out about the passing of the mother of my first boyfriend last July – well, she passed in mid-July, but it was two weeks later when my mother called me. I woke up one morning to a voicemail relating the news. I couldn’t help but notice the fact that, in some sense, my mourning was belated, out of sync with the death that provoked it.</p>

<p>Of course, all such emotions (even the banal discovery in the evening that in fact we have left our keys somewhere) are after the fact, as how can we have a feeling about something we do not know has happened? And indeed, it is only in very recent times that we would even expect to be informed in a timely manner of even these most important matters – in the days where the fastest a letter could travel was a sailboat or horseback, one could find oneself in the position of making a much larger mental adjustment upon receipt of a letter than the two weeks I found myself making, as I thought back to what I had been doing on the day that was now defined as her last.</p>

<p>I posted the link to the obituary in the Times on Facebook, and I asked my mother to save the paper copy. A Facebook friend (ugh, Mark, we have you to thank for this sad <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/magazine/on-language-return-of-the-retronyms.html">retronym</a>) thanked me for introducing me to her work (she was a scholar) a response that threw me for a moment… it hadn’t crossed my mind at the time, but the woman I knew privately – indeed, she had at one point been like a second mother to me – was (naturally) not the woman described in the article, which (also naturally) described her public persona. But although I am telling you what she meant to me here and now, it would never have crossed my mind to post that sentiment on Facebook.</p>

<h3 id="sitting-shiva-in-the-electronic-age">Sitting shiva in the electronic age</h3>
<p>I have never sat shiva but I am fascinated by it. Traditionally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_(Judaism)">this Jewish custom of mourning the seven first-degree relatives</a> entails stopping the business of regular life for seven days, covering the mirrors in your house, sitting on the floor or on low stools, and receiving the visits of family, friends and community. In its fullest form, this practice is, like most religious rituals of old religions, quite elaborate and, were I to have occasion to adopt it (my parents – the only first-degree relatives I posses – however, have been instructed they are not allowed to die for many years to come), I would do so as a cook preparing a complex recipe for the first time. Nevertheless, I suspect the adoption of these old rituals would come easier than does navigating the (as yet unformalized, at least to my knowledge) etiquette for what might be called the modern, secular version of shiva: Facebook.</p>

<p>Recently, two friends have lost people close to them, a fact that has been revealed to me via Facebook. In the first case, I managed to insert my foot quite neatly in my mouth by, a month later, writing an email to this friend in which I made no mention of this death. Although of course I had seen the posts relating the friend’s friend passing, I had no idea how close she (the friend’s friend) had been to her (my friend). I regretted my faux-pas, but I also found myself angry at Facebook for putting me in a situation one would never have been put in – or much less easily so, anyway – in times before the dominance of social media, i.e., of informed uninformedness.</p>

<p>Informed uninformedness is the condition of knowing a fact, but having little or no ability to judge its importance, and thus no cue to respond in a socially appropriate manner. Had my friend communicated directly to me about her friend’s death, she would have automatically contextualized it, since she would have known that otherwise I would not have understood that this person was a very close friend of hers. Announcing it on Facebook, while not inappropriate and of course convenient, could not give everyone the necessary (individual) context that is required for the most effective social assimilation of this information. I do not blame my friend for my putting my foot in my mouth, but I worry that there is very little way to prevent this kind of thing from occurring over and over.</p>

<p>My other example is of a different sort, but poses, at least in my opinion, no less of an etiquette dilemma. On a Saturday morning, I checked into Facebook only to discover that a friend of mine had just lost her father. Clearly, there is no ambiguity about the importance of such an event; the death of a parent is often a defining milestone in one’s life, no matter at what age it comes. Moreover, I knew very well the specifics of my friend’s father’s health issues and the difficulties of their relationship. Here the issue was not a lack of information, but a confusion on how to reply, on what was expected of a friend in this circumstance. Should I post a reply? If so, what could one say that would somehow be appropriate for everyone to see and yet not merely generic? Again, I found myself frustrated.</p>

<p>Facebook has created a public forum for all sorts of events and emotions, from the banal to the breathtaking, but I have the nagging suspicion that it does better with the banal. Or perhaps for me, personally, the banal banter raises fewer questions and causes me less anxiety. I have nothing against anyone mourning on Facebook; grief appropriately has both a public and private aspect, a personal and communal part to it. Yet I still think I will stick to phone calls and snail mail greeting cards. In short, I will stick to the retronyms of mourning, if for no other reasons that I know them better.</p>

<h3 id="crimes-opportunities">Crimes, opportunities</h3>
<p>Late one night 23 years ago, a couple took their daughter Carlina to a Harlem hospital with a high fever. The woman to whom they relinquished their 19-year-old baby wasn’t a nurse, however, even though she was apparently dressed like one. She was Ann Pettway, who kidnapped Carlina and raised her as Nejdra Nance in Bridgeport, CT.</p>

<p>You have to wonder if there had been other nights in which Ms. Pettway had haunted those halls, costumed as a nurse, awaiting possible prey. Or could the nurse impersonation thing have had its own <em>raison d’être</em>, and the stealing of a baby arisen as a non-premeditated crime of opportunity?</p>

<p>Stranger still, Carlina long suspected that her mother was not actually – or even legitimately but non-biologically – her mother. Ms. Pettway could never produce her birth certificate or her social security card. Eventually, she solved her own kidnapping case by finding a photo that looked like (and was) here on the website of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Twenty-three years is a long time, certainly, but it does not seem to have taken very long at all for Carlina to connect with her actual mother, as if that space had been magically preserved in her heart since the day they were accidentally and negligently parted all those years ago.</p>

<p>In this age of confession and networking, one might think that the only kind of secrets around would be open secrets. Somehow, though, people and facts manage to remain hidden, revealed only though due diligence and serendipitous coincidences, as was the case with Patricia Lloyd. Lloyd was recently revealed to be <a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprahs-Family-Secret/">Oprah Winfrey’s half-sister</a>, having been born to Oprah’s mother in 1963 and given up for adoption, entirely unbeknownst to Oprah (who was nine and living with her father at the time). On the same day that Lloyd was told that her birth mother did not want to meet her at that time, she saw an interview on television with Vernita Lee, Oprah’s mother, whose tale of two deceased children matched the details of what Lloyd knew of her own birth mother. And so it was that it occurred to Lloyd and her son that she could very well be related to one of the world’s most recognized women.</p>

<p>But Lloyd didn’t go to the media. Eventually, she went to meet her niece, Alisha, the daughter of her (deceased) sister, who, coincidentally, was also named Patricia (but who went by Pat). The resemblance between Patricia and Pat is, apparently, uncanny. “It was a <em>Beloved</em> moment, if you know what I mean: the daughter who comes back from the dead,” Oprah said, about meeting Lloyd for the first time in November 2010.</p>

<p>Lloyd’s story is all the more remarkable given that she has not tried to profit from the sensationalism that secrets about famous people can instantly provoke, if the media fires are properly stoked. Indeed, Lloyd never went to the press, and hoped that no one else would do so, for fear of causing trouble for her famous half-sister.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Even us pseudo</td>
      <td>anonymous folks, living in the meager spotlight of our computer screens, can appreciate Oprah’s remark about Lloyd’s integrity: “She never once thought to go to the press. She never once thought to sell this story. … When I heard this about you, I said, ‘Regardless if it’s true or not true, I had to meet you because I wanted to meet somebody who had that kind of character.’ So thank you.”</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There are so many ways to define and constitute a family, so much for it to contain – love and strife, togetherness and estrangement, care and abandonment, truths and fictions – yet the word itself seems to be oddly immune to modification. When someone is family, that simply says it all.</p>

          <p>Today I went and visited my great-aunt Lillian in the “manor” where she lives in Dania Beach, FL. At my grandmother’s direction, I stopped at the Walgreen’s (open on Christmas Day, thank you die-hard capitalists!) across the street to buy her some hairspray, which apparently is one of her favorite things and something they are often out of at the Manor’s store.

<p>Lillian is my grandmother’s only remaining sibling. My grandmother is the youngest of 6 (she was “a change of life baby,” to quote her today) and so my great-aunt, the fourth-born, was already 15 when Rita arrived. With five siblings out of childhood, Rita was raised by her brothers and sisters, who showered that sweet child (as Lillian described her) with attention, not only out of kindness, but out of necessity, since her mother was quite ill by that point, and no longer a young woman.</p>

<p>Lillian is 102, set to turn 103 in March 2011. She has outlived her son, sadly, by nearly a decade, and her husband by nearly two. She is quite frank about not understanding why she is still alive… “Enough already!” is her refrain. Especially since either her eyes or her eyeglasses have changed (apparently in an assisted living facility, things are constantly moving or subject to substitution/disappearance, either for real or in the minds of the residents, or a combination thereof) she is unable to read. (When the eye doctor makes his next visit, the situation will be addressed.)</p>

<p>Time, she says, “hangs on her hands,” as it might for all of us at a point in our lives when family is reduced or far away, and the geographic circle of our existence is tightly circumscribed. Lillian is in remarkable shape. She is a bit hard of hearing, and she is liable to confuse names and lineage of people (niece is close enough, and no one calls anyone by the right name in our family, routinely), but she knows who we are, and I was a most welcome visitor.</p>

<p>Other than that, she is still completely lucid, her wits about her, and her memories of the past quite vivid, and her grasp of the present entirely cogent. Up until a few years ago, she lived in a different assisted living facility, much more high-end, and much more expensive. She had her own apartment, but she didn’t interact with very many people.</p>

<p>When it became time to move, my grandmother didn’t think she’d last more than a few weeks in the new place—she was sharing a room (she now has a single) and her former lifestyle was gone forever. And yet she thrived. Though she recalls her former home fondly now (when at the time she did not have that much good to say about it), and she complains about the food at the Manor, she is obviously doing very well.</p>

<p>Unbelievable, but true—you can change your life for the better even at 100. The way she reflects on how she came to be living there, with surprise, acknowledging that she could never have anticipated these circumstances, namely, living so long, exhausting her savings (“you either have to be very rich or a pauper,” she says, accurately summing up the current situation of eldercare in America), is much the way any of us, if we are at all prone to self-reflection, might look at the changes in our own lives that we didn’t anticipate.</p>

<p>Life truly is—be it at 30 or 103—what happens when you are making other plans. Lillian is open about her feelings about not understanding why she is still alive, but she gives no impression of being depressed. With a graceful acceptance, she sums it up by saying that the Manor has some good aspects and some bad, much like everything.</p>

<p>This thing call aging, this state called old age, a destination to which we are all headed—if illness doesn’t take us in our prime, or at least primer, years—is mysterious, even though it its mysteriousness is the opposite of death, which of course is also our shared final destination. While it is hard to imagine death because no one can tell us about it, there are plenty of old people around for us to observe and talk to about being old. I look at my aunt, who is <em>more than 3 times older than me</em> (unreal!), and I see her slackened skin and shrunken muscles, and I think, somehow, if I’m lucky, that will happen to me… And yet even as I see crow’s feet beginning to perch around my eyes, I cannot imagine it.</p>

<p>I know that our culture is going to experience, by necessity, a huge change in regard to how older people are cared for in the next 10-20 years, as there is no way that the current infrastructure is equipped to handle the baby boomers as they head into their 60s, 70s and beyond—and it is also unlikely that the current model is feasible economically, even if the infrastructure existed. If you retire at 65, or even 67 or 70, and you need several thousand dollars a month to provide for your needs, and you may live another 10 to 20 years or more, you are more than likely to run out of money before you die, even if you have saved diligently for retirement.</p>

<p>My mother is fond of speculating that the baby boomers are going to do things differently by choice, perhaps relaunching the commune concept, forming their own shared/assisted living communities based on friendship. I also foresee the concept of inter-generational communities becoming more and more important, and providing structures for care for both the old and the young. If the current model is to outsource, so to speak, the care of older relatives, collecting them in assisted living facilities, the coming model will be somewhat of a cultural throwback, encouraging the reconsideration of the nuclear family as the ideal (economic and social) manifestation of the American Dream.</p>

<p>Anyway, my aunt now has plenty of hairspray.</p>

<p>Through spirit and force of personality, Totò leads an initiative to turn organize the homeless community into a spiffy shantytown. As his mother did before him, he worries about the kids learning their numbers, and decides that he will rename the streets after pieces of the multiplication table: Strada Maggiore becomes Strada 5 x 5 = 25 (Strada cinque per cinque fa venticinque), etc., etc. At least this way, Totò is confident, the children will learn something useful.</p>

<h3 id="my-money-for-your-life">My money for your life</h3>
<p>The innocence of numbers is soon intruded upon the by bigger numbers of capitalism. Oil is discovered on the land, which leads to the new owner’s decision to chase the beggars off the parcel. Additionally, Lolotta descends from heaven to give Totò a magic dove (which she is not allowed to take out of heaven) that can render real any desire Toto asks of it, whether it is the production of two fried eggs on the spot, or the transformation of the policemen ordered to lead the eviction brigage into opera singers incapable of shouting “charge!”.</p>

<p>Once the immediate threat of eviction is avoided, the beggars become enthralled by the powers of the dove, and Totò satisfies their every wish, from material goods (clothes, furniture, etc.) to the removal of physical afflictions (the short man is made taller, the man who stutters has his stutter removed). Even one man’s fantastic desire to make the mannequin in the town square come to life is indulged.</p>

<p>And yet the beggars who shortly before had nothing are nearly instantly consumed the an insatiable desire for more, a process that reaches its climax when a beggar asks for money, which prompts another one to ask for more money, until the series of millioni di millioni di millioni is implicitly infinite.</p>

<h3 id="where-money-doesnt-matter">Where money doesn’t matter</h3>
<p>Here the numbers return, no longer symbols of life’s practical knowledge, engrained within the modest streets of a shantytown, but rather representing the dooming endlessness of infinite (and unspecified) desire.</p>

<p>Distracted by their new passion of consumption, the beggars are eventually rounded up into paddywagons and taken away (a fate not preventable by Totò, as two angels keep descending to take the dove back to heaven).</p>

<p>In the film’s final moments, however, Lolotta manages to give the bird back to her son one final time to allow him to free the beggars and fly them toward heaven on the brooms of street sweepers. They are going to a place where the reign of infinite numbers and consumption does not exist; they are going to the place where “buongiorno really means ‘buongiorno’.”</p>
