  <p>You shall observe my statutes and faithfully keep my ordinances, so that you may live on the land securely. The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live on it securely. […] The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; with me you are but aliens and tenants. Throughout the land that you hold, you shall provide for the redemption of the land.</p>

  <p>—Said to Alice, leaving the bookstore</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Between the walk into town, the chaos of a labyrinthine bookstore, the crowded vastness of a University library’s stacks, and the drenching of a summer thunderstorm, a whole day can be spent in the acquisition of books and the completion, at last in dryness, of one slim volume trudged home.</p>

<p>I don’t know many people who have died, but hardly a week goes by when I don’t meet someone new through his or her obituary. Recently, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/133094306/novelist-professor-reynolds-price-dies">NPR introduced me to Reynolds Price</a>, a well known Duke professor and novelist.</p>

        <p><p>Today I went and visited my great-aunt Lillian in the “manor” where she lives in Dania Beach, FL. At my grandmother’s direction, I stopped at the Walgreen’s (open on Christmas Day, thank you die-hard capitalists!) across the street to buy her some hairspray, which apparently is one of her favorite things and something they are often out of at the Manor’s store. It’s nice to come bearing gifts.</p>

        <p><ul>
  <li>Your brain has a default network that is always on but needs idle time, which it gets in nondreaming sleep as well as during intense and focused intellectual activity. (Is this like saying TV is bad for you?)</li>
  <li>Words go in and out of style–you knew that, but now there’s a (google) app for that. Go, digital humanities, go!</li>
  <li>Don’t believe everything you think. Or rather, what you believe is what you think. Even scientists know about taking things on faith.</li>

        <p><p>The miracles of <em>Miracolo a Milano</em> (1951) are multiple, and they multiply.</p>

<p>The first miracle is the making of a mother out of a poor old woman named Lolotta who finds a baby in her cabbage patch. With obvious joy, she raises her son Totò, educating him with the basic skills she feels important; in particular, she drills hims on his multiplication tables.</p>
