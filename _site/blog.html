(Chapter 10: "The Ultimate Revolution: Demands and Speculations")</p>

<h3>One Famous</h3>
<p>The all-but-state funeral for Margaret Thatcher earlier this month had the peculiar effect of eliding the sizable period of time between the end of the Iron Lady’s reign as Prime Minister (in 1990) and her death. Although she remained in public life for over a decade after that, writing memoirs and giving speeches, her second retirement (as we might dub it) was still over ten years ago. As the recent film “The Iron Lady” makes clear, in her final years, Thatcher suffered from vascular dementia prompted by brain damage suffered during a series of small strokes in March 2002. It was another stroke that finally ended her life this year.</p>

<p><img title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.lightthetunnel.net/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" />Possibly we are scared by the idea that the body outlives the public persona, or, more specifically, the person’s public utility; this is certainly suggested by the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/8996782/David-Cameron-The-Iron-Lady-should-have-been-delayed.html" target="_blank">negative reactions</a> to the film’s depictions of Thatcher as an old woman suffering from dementia. There is a certain irony to David Cameron’s wish for the film to have been delayed, for certainly whatever insult Streep’s honest portrayal provokes is insulting only to those with the luxury of plausible deniability of her day-to-day life. His complaint that “it’s really a film about ageing, dementia, rather than a wonderful prime minister,” confirms his wish not to be reminded of the unfortunate excess of the physical life of the body.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/" target="_blank">Alzheimer’s Society</a>, a British support and advocacy organization, is hopeful that high-profile victims of dementia such as Thatcher will remove some of the obvious stigma surrounding the disease. Upon Thatcher’s death, Jeremy Hughes, the organization’s executive director, <a href="http://www.carehome.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1559713/alzheimers-society-hopes-thatchers-death-will-help-tackle-stigma-of-dementia" target="_blank">noted that</a> ”one in three people over 65 will develop dementia but for too long dementia has been kept in the shadows and families have been left to struggle alone.” Thatcher’s daughter Carol wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swim-Part-Goldfish-Bowl-Memoir/dp/0755317068" target="_blank">a memoir</a> which included a discussion of her mother’s struggles, including the fact that Thatcher would have to be reminded that her husband Dennis had died (in 2003). Carol wrote: “I had to keep giving the bad news over and over again. Every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years, she’d look at me sadly and say ‘oh’, as I struggled to compose myself.”</p>

<p>That dementia is sad and frightening is not in dispute; so are many other deteriorations, physical and mental, of aging. The particular social discomfort of dementia, the one hinted at by David Cameron, seems to rest in the way it probes the limitations of the support structure of the nuclear family: patience, loyalty and financial resources are all tested when a family member suffers from cognitive decline, sometimes to the breaking point. Thatcher clearly took a lot of pride in work and familial self-sufficiency, but it is these same values that keep illnesses such as dementia out of sight and out of mind, a situation of questionable benefit not just to the families who must cope, but for everyone else, too. I am not talking about the financial burdens of illness, as in the context of Britain such a concern is much less an issue, but rather the subtle promotion of the idea that once you no longer meet this self-sufficient expectation, you are no longer fit to appear in the world. The family is thus not only the institution that should, as Thatcher opined, make us self-sufficient, it must also be the institution that covers up any lack of self-sufficiency. This strikes me as an entirely political notion of what the family does, by which I mean it is entirely oriented toward the emergence (under limited conditions) of an individual into the world-at-large. It is emphatically and defiantly not personal.</p>
<h3>The Other (Almost) Forgotten</h3>
<p>Another woman with polarizing ideas died recently, also of a disease—schizophrenia—that is highly stigmatized. Shulamith Firestone, a radical feminist who imagined a Marxist-inspired, cybernetic utopia in which women and children were liberated from the  sexual and economic dependency constituted by the nuclear family unit, was found dead in her New York apartment last August. Reading her opus, <em>The Dialectic of Sex</em>, one is struck by the text’s simultaneous far-reaching and time-boundedness; her passages on the education of children could not be more contemporary in their perception of the failures of the traditional education system to stimulate children toward productive maturity, just as her discussion of overpopulation could not be more landlocked in 1960s preoccupations whose irrelevance the intervening decades have made plain.</p>

<p>Firestone is a pumpkin eater of radical feminism, minus the wife reference; as Susan Faludi’s recent article in the <em>New Yorker</em> puts it: “Shulamith Firestone helped to create a new society. But she couldn’t live in it.” Already in 1970, the publication year of the <em>Dialectic</em><em>, </em>things were headed downhill for Firestone; the fourth organization she’d founded, the New York Radical Feminists, had dissolved over internal conflicts. Firestone had the vision, but short of a Marxist, cybernetic revolution that would free people from drudge work, there was no refuge. Whatever wished-for sisterhood of the radical movement was inadequate to protect those, like Firestone, who would forsake the existing structures of work and family. For a while in the mid-1990s, a support network was cobbled together that allowed her to write a memoir in the form of a <em>roman Ã  clef</em>, <em>Airless Spaces</em>, which was published in 1998. But when the women, including her psychiatrist, all moved on with their own lives, Firestone slipped back into illness and seclusion. It is speculated that she starved to death, deluded by her schizophrenia into believing that her food was poisoned.</p>

<p>One arrangement that Firestone envisioned as an alternative to the nuclear family structure was the <em>household</em>, “a group of ten or some consenting adults of varying ages” who agreed to live together for a contracted period, “perhaps seven to ten years, or whatever was decided on as the minimal time in which children needed a stable structure to grow up in.” Children would comprise say a third of each household; “(minimal) responsibility for the early physical dependence of children would be evenly distributed among all members of the household.” Firestone hopes that through social changes or even the creation of artificial reproduction that the parental feeling of ownership of children would be eliminated, thus making children autonomous and in possession of full legal rights, rather than minors as they are currently termed. “We want to destroy [a mother’s] possessiveness along with its cultural reinforcements so that no one child will be <em>a priori</em> favored over another, so that children will be loved for their own sake.” One right of children would be the right to request a transfer to a different household if he or she did not like “the household into which he had been born so arbitrarily…”</p>

<p>If Firestone’s vision seems implausibly wacky, she deserves credit for having anticipated changes that have already occurred in the decades since she wrote the <em>Dialectic</em><em>, </em>such as the end of stigmas against cohabitation without marriage and homosexuality. While obviously these shifts are not global, they are, in much of the Western world, already past the tipping point of acceptance. (Although it is worth noting the irony, from a Firestone perspective, of the fact that homosexuality has gained more acceptance as it has increasingly insisted that it represents and fosters the same values as ‘traditional’ marriage.) It is important to understand that Firestone’s vision of the household is not a prescription, but rather a suggestion of a way of living that acknowledges a genuine liking of children.</p>
<blockquote>We have seen that parental satisfaction is obtainable only though crippling the child: the attempted extension of ego through one's children—in the case of the man, the 'immortalizing' of name, property, class, and ethnic identification, and in the case of the woman, motherhood as the justification of her existence, the resulting attempt to live through the child, child-as-project—in the end damages or destroys either the child or the parent, or both when neither wins, as the case may be. Perhaps when we strip parenthood of these other functions, we will find a real instinct for parenthood even on the part of men, a simple physical desire to associate with the young. [...] If a parenthood instinct does in fact exist, it will <em>[in the household] </em>be allowed to operate even more freely, having shed the practical burdens of parenthood that now make it such an anguished hell.</blockquote>
<p>Firestone speaks so plainly, so sensitively to the dissatisfactions of existing institutions that it is jarring when she so confidently asserts that one of the main failures of the family is its repression of sexuality, not only of adults but of children. In current mainstream culture, adults who sexualize children are deviants, and children are in part defined as children by their lack of sexual awareness. The legitimate fears about these issues—for ultimately sexual abuse, like rape, is a crime of power before it is a crime of sex—make it very difficult to accept Firestone’s forecasts that with the family structure dissolved, and the incest taboo meaningless, sexuality will revert to “a more natural polymorphous sexuality.” Firestone is as convinced of the harms of current power arrangements (those that subordinate women and children) as she is optimistic about the liberating potential of a radical feminist revolution. She has a fantastic faith in the possibilities of human relationships unfettered from the structures of familial obligation, woven together instead by the pleasures, both simple and profound, of human love.</p>

<p>If only they could have saved her.</p>

(London, 1895)</p>

<blockquote><strong><em>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:</em></strong> So 84 Senators—it's the same question I asked before; 84 Senators based their vote [for DOMA] on moral disapproval of gay people?

<strong><em>MS. KAPLAN:</em></strong> No, I think—I think what is true, Mr. Chief Justice, is that times can blind, and that back in 1996 people did not have the understanding that they have today, that there is no distinction, there is no constitutionally permissible distinction---

<em><strong>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:</strong></em> Well, does that mean—times can blind. Does that mean they did not base their votes on moral disapproval?

<strong><em>MS. KAPLAN:</em></strong> No; some clearly did. I think it was based on an understanding that gay—an incorrect understanding that gay couples were fundamentally different than straight couples, an understanding that I don't think exists today and that's the sense I'm using that times can blind. I think there was—we all can understand that people have moved on this, and now understand that there is no such distinction. So I'm not saying it was animus or bigotry, I think it was based on a misunderstanding on gay people and their---

<strong><em>JUSTICE SCALIA:</em> </strong>Why—why are you so confident in that—in that judgment? How many—how many States permit gay—gay couples to marry?

<strong><em>MS. KAPLAN:</em> </strong>Today? 9, Your Honor.

<strong><em>JUSTICE SCALIA:</em></strong> 9. And—and so there has been this sea change between now and 1996.

<strong><em>MS. KAPLAN:</em> </strong>I think with respect to the understanding of gay people and their relationships there has been a sea change, Your Honor.</blockquote>

(Docket No. 12-137), March 27, 2013.
Ms. Roberta Kaplan argued on behalf of the respondent, Edith Windsor.</p>

<h3>Skim-milk morality</h3>
<p>Eternal youth, though not the malevolent kind bestowed on Wilde’s poor Dorian Gray, would have been an interesting perspective from which to have witnessed the sea change that has occurred in the West over the last century in regard to the personal, moral, social, and legal understandings of same-sex relations and relationships. For it is the young, the surveys consistently say, that are responsible for taking in stride what many of their most liberal-minded elders initially found it hard to stomach. What would it feel like, I wonder, for someone who magically remained an immortal member of the latest generation, to feel his or her moral attitudes evolve with the times, despite the memories of convictions no longer remembered or felt by others? Would it feel strange and destabilizing to see the rate at which human norms alter and shift, or would it feel wonderfully refreshing, an inner renewal to complement the permanence of physical youth? Would our immortal witness become cynical in the face of persistent change, or would she marvel at such evolutions as a crucial hallmark of the human spirit?</p>

<h3>Reaching for the Glass</h3>
<p>I heard on NPR the other day that the twitterverse lit up during the Republican Response to the State of the Union address when Marco Rubio reached for an offstage bottle of water around minute eleven. Apparently, it is a lot easier to respond to that meaningless interruption in under 140 characters than it is to grapple with the purported content of the response. Linda Holmes, in <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/02/13/171903635/rubio-s-water-bottle-and-the-authenticity-craving" target="_blank">her NPR piece on the event</a>, connected that gaffe to the blackout at the Superbowl, saying that these kinds of happenings attract interest because, in a sea of the scripted, they represent an eddy of authenticity.</p>

(By "violence" I mean physical attacks on human beings or the application of physical force to human beings.) Several hundred years ago, violence per se was not considered immoral in European society. In fact, under suitable conditions, it was admired. The most prestigious social class was the nobility, which was then a warrior caste. Even on the eve of the Industrial Revolution violence was not regarded as the greatest of all evils, and certain other values -- personal liberty for example -- were felt to be more important than the avoidance of violence. [...] As the Industrial Revolution progressed, the powerful classes, perceiving that violence was increasingly contrary to their interest, changed their attitude toward it. [...] [T]hey gradually transformed the attitude of the entire society...  Today the media, the schools, and all who are committed to the system brainwash us to believe that violence is the one thing above all others that we must never commit. (Of course, when the system finds it convenient to use violence -- via the police or the military -- for its own purposes, it can always find an excuse for doing so.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">--Theodore J. Kaczynski,
"Morality and Revolution,"
in <em>Technological Slavery</em> (241-42)</p>
<p>Early last Friday morning, a 24-year-old man named James Holmes walked into a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, threw canisters of some breath-complicating gas, and opened fire on the audience that had come out to watch the lastest Batman move, <em>The Dark Night Rises</em>. As of XXX, the death toll is 12, but 11 of the nearly 60 people injured are in serious condition.</p>

<p>The reaction to yet another random shooting in a public venue in suburban American has been greeted with the by-now-familiar mix of shock, grief,  general head-shaking and hand-wringing. The President flew back from the campaign trail to Washington so he could play the consoler-in-chief; perhaps stating the obvious (life is precious, uncertain) looks more presidential than stumping against Richie Rich Romney? Personally, I’d rather have better gun control than the President’s heartfelt prayers, but at this point I’m resigned to getting only the former in this country, from a leader of either party.</p>

<p>I do not believe I’m exaggerating when I claim that it could have been all the children of every member of Congress in that theater, and still no one would be calling for a ban on the sale of the weapons whose power we glorify (precisely in films like <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>) but whose consequences we mourn as if a shooting was an act of God as unpreventable as a tornado. Rather, the right will call for all of us to arm ourselves for protection, and the left will wax philosophical about cherishing the moments between the gunshots. (Thank you, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Zhvk6A3kE" target="_blank">Mayor Bloomberg</a>, for actually demanding more than platitudes.)</p>

<p>And, to add insult to all the injuries past, present, and future, everyone will blame the insane. We know shockingly little about James Holmes, a graduate student at the University of Colorado, Denver, who had reportedly been in the process of withdrawing from the neuroscience program there. But already people who had never heard his name before he was arrested in the darkness of the cinema parking lot feel quite comfortable dismissing him as insane.</p>

<p>As inevitably happens in these sorts of incidents, he will be dismissed as disturbed, insane, etc., and his actions will be assigned to his mental problems, rather than to the availability of automatic weapons. Normal civilians, you see, don’t use guns for the purposes they were intended for – and anyone who does use them to kill random people is, by this tautology, not a normal person.</p>

<p>The familiar call to get better background checks to prevent “people with a history of mental illness” from purchasing firearms is  While most mentally ill people are not violent, and while most crimes are committed by the sane, we go out of our way to absolve social circumstances and assign heinous crimes to individual defect. This is of course to be expected in a country obsessed with the notion of personal responsibility, but this argument is predicated on an outrageously false supposed connection between violence and mental illness.</p>

<p>Breivik gets maximum – will still constitute danger so will probably never be released</p>

<p>No man of her own</p>

<p>If you have no idea of the plot of this Barbara Stanwyck film from 1950, you’ll be pretty surprised to find out at the end of the opening scene that what is rotten in the state of suburban Illinois isn’t infidelity or loss of affection, but murder. The effect of that opening scene’s turn toward the noir is quasi comical; no sooner are we presented with the comfortable husband and wife, he with book, she with baby, in what appears to be a generic crisis of conjugal anomie than the voiceover takes us out of traditional melodrama and into film noir.</p>

<p>Murder, then, is at the heart of the film, and although I could very easily write an entire post about movie, instead I will take it as a jumping off point to compose a post I have been mulling over for a quite a while now about the evolution of murder shows on television.</p>

<p>Thanks to Netflix, it is now possible to relive many of our favorite shows minus the agony of advertising: nostalgia can perhaps be redefined as memory without commercial breaks. That comforting ritual that is the murder mystery, returns familiar but improved – the past is somehow brought back purer than ever in the midst of the relentless encroachment of advertising into every nook and cranny of our lives. Just this past week I’ve been listening to play-by-play baseball radio announcers seamlessly introduce ad copy into their calling of the game. Is nothing sacred?</p>

  <p>The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties. —James Madison, <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm">The Federalist <em>No. 10</em></a></p>

Mr. Cain, I implore you, make this right so that you and the country can move forward and focus on the real issues at hand. Thank you.</blockquote>

<p>At first I was delighted that Herman Cain’s serial sexual harassment of women took a toll on his popularity. But as Newt Gingrich supplanted him as the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, my delight turned back to dismay. Not that I thought Cain’s workplace misdeeds disqualified him to be President. His arrogance, ignorance, inexperience, and conservatism-poorly-disguised-as-populism disqualify him – or at least would, if we weren’t living in the topsy-turvy political world known as the Republican Presidential Nomination Process, aka, the Race to the Bottom of the Barrel.</p>

<p>Ah, but no matter how our waistlines and wallets fare this year, we can count on family and friends to welcome us in from the cold of a winter’s night.</p>

<!--           <p>This is, supposedly, the season of giving. In economic terms, this translates into an annual ritual in which we buy things as a sign of our love and friendship for those around us.
Is it so odd of a question to ask why we do this? Do we need these gifts to feel appreciated? And do we enjoy shopping for things to give other people, with all the worry about how much money we spend and if these gifts will be enjoyed?</p>

<blockquote>Although I am a well-known person and have made my career as a professional athlete, I have been dismayed to realize the full extent of what tabloid scrutiny really means. For the last week, my family and I have been hounded to expose intimate details of our personal lives. . . .

But no matter how intense curiosity about public figures can be, there is an important and deep principle at stake which is the right to some simple, human measure of privacy. I realize there are some who don't share my view on that. But for me, the virtue of privacy is one that must be protected in matters that are intimate and within one's own family. Personal sins should not require press releases and problems within a family shouldn't have to mean public confessions.

Whatever regrets I have about letting my family down have been shared with and felt by us alone. I have given this a lot of reflection and thought and I believe that there is a point at which I must stick to that principle even though it's difficult.</blockquote>

<p>Tiger, though a public figure, insists here that there is a limit to the public’s right-to-know, and that he should not be expected to render a public accounting of his misdeeds.</p>
