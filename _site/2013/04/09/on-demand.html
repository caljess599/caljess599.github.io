<blockquote><span style="font-size: 16px;">I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!"...  and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves firstâ€¦</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>No, you will not get a job—not because, like Kafka's mouse, you went in the "wrong" direction, but because today's academic job market is a "market" in the sense that one stall selling fiddlehead ferns in the middle of a strip mall is a "farmer's market." In the place of actual jobs are adjunct positions: benefit-free, office-free academic servitude in which you will earn $18,000 a year for the rest of your life.</blockquote>
