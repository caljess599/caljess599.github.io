  <p>I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand “I have a problem, it is the Government’s job to cope with it!”…  and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.</p>

  <p> I submit, then, that the first demand for any alternative system must be: (1) <em>The freeing of women from the tyranny of reproduction by every means possible, and the diffusion of the child-rearing role to the society as a whole, men as well as women</em>. […] There are the the more distant solutions based on the potentials of modern embryology, that is, artificial reproduction, possibilities still so frightening that they are seldom discussed seriously. […] To free women thus from their biology would be to threaten the <em>social</em> unit that is organized around biological reproduction and the subjection of women to their biological destiny, the family. Our second demand also will come as a basic contradiction to the family, this time the family as an <em>economic</em> unit. (2) <em>The political autonomy, based on economic independence, of both women and children</em>.</p>

<p>The all-but-state funeral for Margaret Thatcher earlier this month had the peculiar effect of eliding the sizable period of time between the end of the Iron Lady’s reign as Prime Minister (in 1990) and her death. Although she remained in public life for over a decade after that, writing memoirs and giving speeches, her second retirement (as we might dub it) was still over ten years ago. As the recent film “The Iron Lady” makes clear, in her final years, Thatcher suffered from vascular dementia prompted by brain damage suffered during a series of small strokes in March 2002. It was another stroke that finally ended her life this year.</p>

<p>Possibly we are scared by the idea that the body outlives the public persona, or, more specifically, the person’s public utility; this is certainly suggested by the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/8996782/David-Cameron-The-Iron-Lady-should-have-been-delayed.html">negative reactions</a> to the film’s depictions of Thatcher as an old woman suffering from dementia. There is a certain irony to David Cameron’s wish for the film to have been delayed, for certainly whatever insult Streep’s honest portrayal provokes is insulting only to those with the luxury of plausible deniability of her day-to-day life. His complaint that “it’s really a film about ageing, dementia, rather than a wonderful prime minister,” confirms his wish not to be reminded of the unfortunate excess of the physical life of the body.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/">Alzheimer’s Society</a>”, a British support and advocacy organization, is hopeful that high-profile victims of dementia such as Thatcher will remove some of the obvious stigma surrounding the disease. Upon Thatcher’s death, Jeremy Hughes, the organization’s executive director, <a href="http://www.carehome.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1559713/alzheimers-society-hopes-thatchers-death-will-help-tackle-stigma-of-dementia">noted that</a> ”one in three people over 65 will develop dementia but for too long dementia has been kept in the shadows and families have been left to struggle alone.” Thatcher’s daughter Carol wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swim-Part-Goldfish-Bowl-Memoir/dp/0755317068">a memoir</a> which included a discussion of her mother’s struggles, including the fact that Thatcher would have to be reminded that her husband Dennis had died (in 2003). Carol wrote: “I had to keep giving the bad news over and over again. Every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years, she’d look at me sadly and say ‘oh’, as I struggled to compose myself.”</p>

<p>That dementia is sad and frightening is not in dispute; so are many other deteriorations, physical and mental, of aging. The particular social discomfort of dementia, the one hinted at by David Cameron, seems to rest in the way it probes the limitations of the support structure of the nuclear family: patience, loyalty and financial resources are all tested when a family member suffers from cognitive decline, sometimes to the breaking point. Thatcher clearly took a lot of pride in work and familial self-sufficiency, but it is these same values that keep illnesses such as dementia out of sight and out of mind, a situation of questionable benefit not just to the families who must cope, but for everyone else, too. I am not talking about the financial burdens of illness, as in the context of Britain such a concern is much less an issue, but rather the subtle promotion of the idea that once you no longer meet this self-sufficient expectation, you are no longer fit to appear in the world. The family is thus not only the institution that should, as Thatcher opined, make us self-sufficient, it must also be the institution that covers up any lack of self-sufficiency. This strikes me as an entirely political notion of what the family does, by which I mean it is entirely oriented toward the emergence (under limited conditions) of an individual into the world-at-large. It is emphatically and defiantly not personal.</p>

<p>Another woman with polarizing ideas died recently, also of a disease—schizophrenia—that is highly stigmatized. Shulamith Firestone, a radical feminist who imagined a Marxist-inspired, cybernetic utopia in which women and children were liberated from the  sexual and economic dependency constituted by the nuclear family unit, was found dead in her New York apartment last August. Reading her opus, <em>The Dialectic of Sex</em>, one is struck by the text’s simultaneous far-reaching and time-boundedness; her passages on the education of children could not be more contemporary in their perception of the failures of the traditional education system to stimulate children toward productive maturity, just as her discussion of overpopulation could not be more landlocked in 1960s preoccupations whose irrelevance the intervening decades have made plain.</p>

<p>Firestone is a pumpkin eater of radical feminism, minus the wife reference; as Susan Faludi’s recent article in the <em>New Yorker</em> puts it: “Shulamith Firestone helped to create a new society. But she couldn’t live in it.” Already in 1970, the publication year of the <em>Dialectic</em>, things were headed downhill for Firestone; the fourth organization she’d founded, the New York Radical Feminists, had dissolved over internal conflicts. Firestone had the vision, but short of a Marxist, cybernetic revolution that would free people from drudge work, there was no refuge. Whatever wished-for sisterhood of the radical movement was inadequate to protect those, like Firestone, who would forsake the existing structures of work and family. For a while in the mid-1990s, a support network was cobbled together that allowed her to write a memoir in the form of a <em>roman à clef</em>, <em>Airless Spaces</em>, which was published in 1998. But when the women, including her psychiatrist, all moved on with their own lives, Firestone slipped back into illness and seclusion. It is speculated that she starved to death, deluded by her schizophrenia into believing that her food was poisoned.</p>

<p>One arrangement that Firestone envisioned as an alternative to the nuclear family structure was the <em>household</em>, “a group of ten or some consenting adults of varying ages” who agreed to live together for a contracted period, “perhaps seven to ten years, or whatever was decided on as the minimal time in which children needed a stable structure to grow up in.” Children would comprise say a third of each household; “(minimal) responsibility for the early physical dependence of children would be evenly distributed among all members of the household.” Firestone hopes that through social changes or even the creation of artificial reproduction that the parental feeling of ownership of children would be eliminated, thus making children autonomous and in possession of full legal rights, rather than minors as they are currently termed. “We want to destroy [a mother’s] possessiveness along with its cultural reinforcements so that no one child will be <em>a priori</em> favored over another, so that children will be loved for their own sake.” One right of children would be the right to request a transfer to a different household if he or she did not like “the household into which he had been born so arbitrarily…”</p>

<p>If Firestone’s vision seems implausibly wacky, she deserves credit for having anticipated changes that have already occurred in the decades since she wrote the <em>Dialectic</em>, such as the end of stigmas against cohabitation without marriage and homosexuality. While obviously these shifts are not global, they are, in much of the Western world, already past the tipping point of acceptance. (Although it is worth noting the irony, from a Firestone perspective, of the fact that homosexuality has gained more acceptance as it has increasingly insisted that it represents and fosters the same values as ‘traditional’ marriage.) It is important to understand that Firestone’s vision of the household is not a prescription, but rather a suggestion of a way of living that acknowledges a genuine liking of children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have seen that parental satisfaction is obtainable only though crippling the child: the attempted extension of ego through one’s children—in the case of the man, the ‘immortalizing’ of name, property, class, and ethnic identification, and in the case of the woman, motherhood as the justification of her existence, the resulting attempt to live through the child, child-as-project—in the end damages or destroys either the child or the parent, or both when neither wins, as the case may be. Perhaps when we strip parenthood of these other functions, we will find a real instinct for parenthood even on the part of men, a simple physical desire to associate with the young. […] If a parenthood instinct does in fact exist, it will [in the household] be allowed to operate even more freely, having shed the practical burdens of parenthood that now make it such an anguished hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firestone speaks so plainly, so sensitively to the dissatisfactions of existing institutions that it is jarring when she so confidently asserts that one of the main failures of the family is its repression of sexuality, not only of adults but of children. In current mainstream culture, adults who sexualize children are deviants, and children are in part defined as children by their lack of sexual awareness. The legitimate fears about these issues—for ultimately sexual abuse, like rape, is a crime of power before it is a crime of sex—make it very difficult to accept Firestone’s forecasts that with the family structure dissolved, and the incest taboo meaningless, sexuality will revert to “a more natural polymorphous sexuality.” Firestone is as convinced of the harms of current power arrangements (those that subordinate women and children) as she is optimistic about the liberating potential of a radical feminist revolution. She has a fantastic faith in the possibilities of human relationships unfettered from the structures of familial obligation, woven together instead by the pleasures, both simple and profound, of human love.</p>

<p>If only they could have saved her.</p>
