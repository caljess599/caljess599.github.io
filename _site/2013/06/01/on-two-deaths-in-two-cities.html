<h3 id="london-hacking-in-the-street">London, Hacking in the Street</h3>
<p>Michael Adebolajo is a British-born citizen of Nigerian descent, but apparently neither the circumstances of his birth, nor his upbringing in London, nor the Christianity of his parents provided a bulwark against what has been characterized as his radicalization by jihadist Islam, a process that apparently began when he was fifteen and culminated a few days ago in his participation in the brutal murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in suburban London. (And included, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22673164">several years ago</a>, an arrest in Kenya after attempting to enter Somalia to train with jihadists.)</p>

<p>The now-viral video confrontation with one of the passers-by reveals the sang-froid, indeed, the casualness with which he committed this act, but its more important revelation may be the earnestness with which the young man wants to speak to others, if only he can get them to listen. He is not ranting at the man videoing him, or at the anticipated audience in general. Indeed, he is apologizing for the overt nature of his act (not, of course, the act itself), for it is not the murder itself that he wants witnessed. Rather, he wants the attention that he knows he can garner for having murdered. In part, he uses the spotlight to express his anger against Western governments for waging war in Muslim nations, nations with which he identifies himself completely.</p>

<p>But beyond these clichÃ©s of Islamist terrorism in which all non-Muslims are the enemy, and all murders of infidels are justified by the killing of Muslims around the world, Adebolajo seems to have another layer of concern in which he is not hostile to his audience, but in fact identifies with them and even has sympathy for them. In a remark that could not be more contrary to the notion that every infidel is an equally implicated, and therefore legitimate, target, Adebolajo explains that the politicians have no skin in the game that they are playing; it is the little people—like the solidier, like the by-standers, like himself—who risk and lose their lives to the wars concocted by the powers that be.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://world.time.com/2013/05/22/man-hacked-to-death-in-suspected-terrorist-attack-in-london/">comment posted on the Time World website</a>, a user named EdLifton suggested that it wasn’t lofty ideas that motivated Adebolajo so much as the feeling of littleness—and the need to overcome it—that is characteristic of narcissism. In this reading, the actions are not parseable politically but psychologically, i.e., the need to act to assuage such feelings far exceeds the political impact of the act itself. But if one requirement of narcissism is delusions of grandeur (à la Mohammed Atta), Adebolajo doesn’t qualify: instead of dispatching himself to a martyr-filled heaven (say, with a suicide bomb), he waits around to get shot at by the police (and then arrested and taken to hospital). The frenzied murder appears as a momentary escape from the general banality of the life of a little person.</p>

<p>Indeed, in my mind, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt-ySTx3xH8">the most compelling aspect of the video itself</a> [start at 0:46] is the dark-skinned woman, her hair covered (perhaps a Muslim?), towing her grocery cart across the scene, observing but apparently not all that alarmed by the just-completed murder. As Adebolajo concludes his speech, the woman passes by him on the sidewalk, barely glancing at him as she skirts around him, perhaps not perceiving, or perhaps choosing not to look at, his bloodied hands and the bloody weapons they still hold.</p>

<p>What is her story? Does she simply discount violence on the street as the misfortune of others, best not to think too much about? Did she think it was a traffic accident? Is she accustomed to violence, and perhaps was non-plussed? Did she purposely avoid even noticing what was going on in that street, because she couldn’t be bothered? The irony here is pretty rich: Adebolajo is trying to alarm people about the consequences of the fact that America and Britain (and other allies) have been fighting and killing militants and civilians in Afghanistan (among other places), and here walks by a woman who clearly could not give a shit about what he’s up to.</p>

<p>The irony is even deeper, though, when you consider that it is precisely the attitude of that woman that keeps the world going—she’s keeping calm and carrying on.  She’s not interested in jihad; she’s interested in getting home and getting off her feet. As are most of us, no? If this weren’t the case, meaning, if we were all interested in committing or responding to violence with violence, we’d all be dead in the streets. The terror instilled by Adebolajo is, I think it is safe to say, the worry that more and more people will break out of this peace-promoting attitude of apathy and decide to commit murder instead of, say, go to the movies. (Already <a href="http://www.thelocal.fr/20130527/attacker-prayed-before-knifing-paris-soldier">a knifing of a soldier in Paris</a> is under investigation as a copy cat attack.)</p>

<p>This is a legitimate worry, because it is the individual who chooses, and short of a society in which no one is free and most are miserable (think North Korea), there is no way to guarantee individual safety while honoring individual liberty. Personal liberty exists by the grace of personal discretion, and there is only so much degradation of individual tendencies (i.e., toward violence, greed, dishonesty, etc.) that a society can tolerate and still be free. In this way, Adebolajo’s murder in the streets (despite its origins in jihad) is no different than Adam Lanza’s shooting spree in Newtown, Connecticut, or James Holmes’s at the movies in Aurora, Colorado: they introduce violence into a setting where we had enjoyed an expectation of safety, thus breaking an essential social covenant.</p>

<h3 id="paris-shooting-at-the-altar">Paris, Shooting at the Altar</h3>
<p>Hovering like a wasp around Dominique Venner’s final pessimistic outburst about the fall of the West is the irony that, on the issue of gay marriage, he and the Islamists are on the same side: deeply against it. Venner’s allegiance to the far right puts a lie to the notion that the fault line between the West and its enemies is simply social liberalism. On the contrary, Venner has the same fight to pick with the Islamists as he does with the more progressive elements of his own culture: the battle of a deep conservative against any and all change. He is just as incensed by the change represented by immigration as he is the internal transformations within France’s existing white, (nominally) Catholic population. In short, he’s an equal opportunity hater.</p>

<p>Considered from a psychological standpoint, a Catholic’s commission of suicide (a mortal sin) in a church (an act of desecration) suggests that Mr. Venner’s problems ran deeper than politically-engaged rage. Even when considered as a political act, Mr. Venner had to know that even if his death counted as one of the “new, spectacular and symbolic gestures” he believed were required to wake people up, it seems less reasonable to suppose that such a betrayal of his supposed values could function as part of the “intellectual and moral reform” he believed, quoting Renan Camus, was necessary to prevent the fall of Europe to Islamists. While Venner is convinced that street demonstrations (the hallmark perhaps of dissent in Western democracies) will be insufficient, his actions do not seem to match his rhetoric; after all, the notion of “fighting back the infidels” has a long European history, but it appears that Europe has lost its interest in both Crusades and colonialism. Perhaps his death is an acknowledgment that the only kind of violence conservatism can achieve is self-immolation.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Venner only injured himself in his dramatic suicide at Notre Dame Cathedral last week, while Mr. Adebolajo committed murder, both men seem to be actors caught on a stage without an audience, having cast themselves in roles and scripts that are more fiction than fact <em>as far as regards them personally</em>. It is certainly true that the emergence of a tolerant, successfully multicultural Europe is a work-in-progress, but Mr. Venner’s apocalyptic sense of European demise is just as much a product of his imagination as Mr. Adebolajo’s allegiance with all Muslims in his unnamed “our land”.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Muslims aren’t being killed by Western armies in armed conflicts and by drone warfare (indeed, as we learned this week, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2013/0522/Drone-strikes-Four-American-citizens-killed-in-drone-strikes-video">even American citizens have been targeted</a>). But it is to say that the Muslims of Britain are not in this situation, and indeed are busy with lives that have no interest in violence, just like the woman who walks by him while he is being videoed. While Adebolajo may have been radicalized to believe that he is an outsider in the country in which he has been born and raised, this radicalization is not a point of fact but a mindset, even a delusion. While his actions are terrifying, his murder of a British soldier does not actually make his delusion more of a reality. The reality is more fully captured by the woman who walks by him—<em>that</em> is the land in which Adebolajo lives, despite his efforts to make it something it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. Venner is similarly driven to excess by delusion, seeing in his likely even-keeled day-to-day reality a cataclysm that simply isn’t there. Perhaps it is too easy for me, who sees no cultural threat in same-sex marriage, to dismiss his concerns. But it is not defensible to agree that simply by allowing same-sex couples equal rights under the law that something has been taken away from others. In this way, Mr. Venner’s loss is as imaginary as is Mr. Adebolajo’s connection to Afganistan.  </p>

<p>These two sketches paint the same definition of extremism: an extremist is someone who narcissistically mistakes his own internal need for validation for the pressing struggles of his fellow man. The greatest stories of human struggle and hope (from story of Exodus to the American and French Revolutions to Civil Rights) have in common a recognition of the needs of many, rather than a violent, destructive ignorance of the real goals and activities of human society. No amount of security (whether at airports or at schools) can prevent a hell-bent attacker from carrying out his or her mission; our best hope is to engage ourselves in the activities of living that narcissist terrorists are incapable of acknowledging.</p>

<p>We need to keep calm and carry on.</p>
