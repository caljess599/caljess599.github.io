  <p>You see I want to be quite obstinate about insisting that we have no way of knowing—beyond that fundamental loyalty to the social code—what is “right” and what is “wrong,” what is “good” and what “evil.” I dwell so upon this because the most disturbing aspect of “morality” seems to me the frequency with which the word now appears; in the press, on television, in the most perfunctory kinds of conversation. Questions of straightforward power (or survival) politics, questions of quite indifferent public policy, questions of almost anything: they are all assigned these factitious moral burdens. There is something facile going on, some self-indulgence at work. Of course we would all like to “believe” in something, like to assuage our private guilts in public causes, like to lose our tiresome selves; like, perhaps, to transform the white flag of defeat at home into the brave white banner of battle away from home. And of course it is right to do that; that is how, immemorially, things have gotten done. But I think it is all right only so long as… <!--more-->we recognize that the end may or may not be expedient, may or may not be a good idea, but in any case has nothing to do with “morality.” Because when we start deceiving ourselves into thinking not that we want something or need something, not that it is a pragmatic necessity for us to have it, but that it is a <em>moral imperative</em> that we have it, then is when we join the fashionable madmen, and then is when the thin whine of hysteria is heard in the land, and then is when we are in bad trouble. And I suspect we are already there.</p>

<p>I heard on NPR the other day that the twitterverse lit up during the Republican Response to the State of the Union address when Marco Rubio reached for an offstage bottle of water around minute eleven. Apparently, it is a lot easier to respond to that meaningless interruption in under 140 characters than it is to grapple with the purported content of the response. Linda Holmes, in <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/02/13/171903635/rubio-s-water-bottle-and-the-authenticity-craving">her NPR piece on the event</a>, connected that gaffe to the blackout at the Superbowl, saying that these kinds of happenings attract interest because, in a sea of the scripted, they represent an eddy of authenticity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In all honesty, the water gulp was just about the only part of that evening you couldn’t have known was going to happen 24 hours earlier. Just like the blackout, it was the major plot development (minor as it was) that felt like a collapse of the narrative, and the truth is, people <em>like</em> collapsed narratives. They feel, to use a nonword, <em>real-er</em>, truer, simpler, and more reflective of our experiences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holmes’ connection between the collapsed narrative and authenticity strikes me as a rather curious paring. It suggests something rather odd about the notion of narrative itself, namely, that when it is functioning properly, it feels boring and/or fake. Basically, Holmes’ definition of narrative here is basically that of spin: non-nuanced, predictable, and anti-climatic.</p>

<p>Without disputing the fact that our two-party politics has degenerated into both parties saying that they want what is best for American families while remaining unable to agree on anything except the least-sensical proposal of all, the looming Sequester, aka the Fiscal Cliff, historically (by which I mean in ancient Greece) politics was a realm that was so highly regarded precisely because it dealt in the realm of nuance and the unpredictable. Accordingly, the means of politics, rhetorical speech, was regarded as the highest form of human activity, and the honor of participating in the formation of events was restricted to a small group of men. The narrative form that imitated and enshrined this human activity was none other than Greek tragedy, which was born in the midst of the Athenian <em>polis</em>. In short, the very notion of drama—of climatic and difficult narratives—came out of an appreciation of the unpredictability of human interaction.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is hopeless, in the way of modernism, post-modernism, and post-post-modernism, to try to argue against the viewpoint that, in this day and age, narrative in its original operational form no longer ‘works’, and therefore we get our thrills from the points where it is collapsed, punctured, dismantled, made fun of. While there is plenty of art and literature that functions though subversion of traditional narrative techniques, its success in doing so depends on the audience’s awareness of such tradition. Arguably, all movements that have sought to undermine or subvert a previous order have, originally, emerged from within order. And nor do those movements necessarily supplant what came before, at least not immediately; most often, they come into their own along side it.</p>

<p>Therefore I’m not convinced that the excitement that we get from things going wrong (mere <em>schadenfreude</em>), whether in political speeches or major sporting events, has anything to do with a craving for so-called ‘collapsed narratives,’ or a craving for the ‘real’ over the ‘scripted’. ‘Reality,’ as any good post-modernist will tell you, is not the absence of scripting. Reality itself is scripted—by the mind, by language, by culture, and, ever-increasingly, by ‘social’ media. This latest turn of the screw leads many people to believe that reality consists in what people say about them, one of the basic falsehoods of life we were all supposed to have exploded for us in childhood.</p>

<p>But to return to the original discussion, the complaint about entertainment being scripted is misguided. We all watch entertainment that is entirely, in terms of its narrative gestures, predictable—at least from a structural standpoint. Whether you are watching <em>The Good Wife</em> or <em>The Amazing Race</em>, what keeps your attention is the creation, management and climax/resolution of the essential narrative mainstay since the Greeks: action (or, put another way, conflict). Action is the way the Greeks would have understood it, for they understood action as a priori in a collective, political context, and therefore inherently fraught with uncertainty and danger; since the term action has lost these connotations, it is perhaps more intelligible for us to say conflict, which recovers some of those connotations.</p>

<p>I seem to be on the verge of claiming that there is no conflict <em>within</em> our political speeches or our Superbowls, and so that is why the only element of interest is a conflict <em>around</em> them (water break, power outage). I think that’s a fair statement, although the caveat that must be understood is the modern (for the Greeks anyway) separation between political speech and political action. In the context of the <em>polis</em>, what you spoke was already a form of action. Nowadays, the state and society go on regardless of what anyone says (meaning, regardless of the conflicts spoken about), dependent much more on the stability of financial markets than the consistency of political discourse. (This is why regimes that restrict speech in order to maintain power seem so retro.) If Marco Rubio’s words were spoken in such a context (a political actor among other actors), his drinking water would be beside the point, rather than the only point anyone could find worth mentioning. The risk would be in his words, not in his reaching for a beverage.</p>

<h3 id="never-again">Never Again</h3>
<p>Every February, Valentine’s Day serves as a good occasion to talk about issues regarding love and marriage. This time, the NY Time’s “Room For Debate” featured a discussion between Vicki Larson and Beverly Willett, the latter of whom is the co-chair of the <a href="http://divorcereform.us/">Coalition for Divorce Reform</a></p>

<p>Ms. Willett, like perhaps many spouses, found herself in the predicament of not wanting to get divorced while her husband did. Under current no-fault divorce law, however, it only takes one person’s desire to get divorced to make that result inevitable. Ms. Willett was able to prolong the fight for her marriage for five years due only to the fact that she and her husband resided in New York State, which for many years remained the only state in the nation without no-fault divorce. (The state <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/nyregion/16divorce.html?_r=0">changed the law in 2010</a> Yet even under that old system, even the judges did not seem sympathetic to the notion of a wife wanting to legally obligate her husband to remain married when he had already taken up with another woman. If anything, the law was designed to allow Ms. Willett to sue her adulterous husband for divorce in order to spare her the pain of remaining married to someone who had deserted her.</p>

<p>For Ms. Willett, who was willing to forgive her husband’s behavior in order to keep her family together, the law offered no help. Ms. Willett views this as a shortcoming of the law, and supports the <a href="http://divorcereform.us/parental-divorce-reduction-act/">Parental Divorce Reduction Act</a>, which, though mandated counseling and waiting periods, seeks to reduce what it calls “unnecessary” divorces where there are minor children involved. The problem, as Ms. Larson points out, is that what may be a necessary divorce to some may not feel like that to others. Have people gotten divorced because they were selfish and pig-headed and didn’t want to work on themselves or their relationship? Undoubtedly. Have those divorces had negative consequences for children involved? Probably. And yet you have to ask yourself whether the law exists to prevent these situations. Perhaps the reason the law offers no help is because the law can only respond to behavior, not create it.</p>

<p>Of course it is hoped—as in the case of laws against drunk driving or texting-while-moving—that a legal change will influence behavior, but whatever the behavior, it existed before the law conferred upon it the status of a misdemeanor or crime. In the case of marriage, which exists to establish a particular contractual status between two individuals, the law functions not as an incentive, but as a legal overlay to a cultural institution. So when the culture shifted and people wanted easier divorce, the law accommodated them. Likewise, it is a cultural shift that is driving the legalization of same-sex marriage. No matter what you think of no-fault divorce or same-sex marriage, you have to admit that the law is much better at being the permissive parent (“If this is what you want, okay”) than the moralizing one (“I’m not going to let you do this because I know it’s not for the best”). Basically, if religion couldn’t keep us all happily (or even unhappily!) married, then the law hasn’t got a chance.</p>

<p>Ms. Willett taps into a very American ideal in her wish to prevent other couples from divorcing: the desire to make things better for the next person. This is an excellent example of what Joan Didion means about our desire “to transform the white flag of defeat at home into the brave white banner of battle away from home.” Personal hardship has long been the rallying cry for collective action. And in certain cases, it is possible to change the larger circumstances of a situation so that things don’t happen all over again the same way. The fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory changed working conditions for factory workers; the creation of Social Security and Medicare has kept many elderly people out of the poverty they would have otherwise fallen into. What leads us to this sense of right action is our apprehension of common humanity, this notion that “but for the grace of God there go I.” But the other side of this natural sympathy is an almost equally natural self-righteousness, that feeling that the world should be structured after one’s own sense of rectitude. It is not a far hop from a feeling indulgent toward the poor to feeling distrustful of their own capacities to decide for themselves. Our experience becomes not so much a well of sympathy (compassion) but a recipe book (prescription): if my divorce—or abortion, or what-have-you—was a mistake, then all divorces, etc. are mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="charity-begins-at-home">Charity Begins at Home</h3>
<p>I was talking to a friend of mine about the concept of a voting district, and how party-based gerrymandering has given us a more-or-less polarized national legislature in which the parties equally believe that they represent their constituents and yet they are unable to work together on anything. Wouldn’t a system where the center could hold be much more effective? Why, he asked me, do you think compromise is so great? Instead of one side being unhappy, both sides are. The problem, he went on, isn’t in how we elect our national representatives, it is in the fact that we try to decide too many things on a national level.</p>

<p>My friend’s libertarian live-and-let live vision depends not on representation but on distribution. Basically, the laws and customs of a certain area would be governed by the residents of that place. For example, people in the city don’t think guns are necessary, so you wouldn’t carry them there. People in the county are okay with that, so you would be fine to do so. Instead of the county folks trying to make it legal in the city, and the city folks trying to make it illegal in the county, you would take a “when in Rome” attitude. Instead of voting at the ballot box, you’d vote with your feet and your wallet. Why legislate when you can migrate?</p>

<p>Migration is actually the way that people historically dealt with persecution. Many of the early American settlers left England because they couldn’t worship as they wished to there. Nowadays, many Americans take it as a point of pride that we can (well, most of us) live cheek-by-jowl with people of different faiths. Certainly this arrangement is nothing to be sneezed at, given the amount of sectarian unrest and violence in the word. However, it has become a sort of American tic to expect our needs to be met no matter where we go, as if the law was something that existed outside of the minds and the hearts of the people under it. This is true whether the cause is access to abortion, concealed carry laws, or gay marriage. Whichever side you are on of any of these issues, the way you feel about them likely doesn’t stop at the county line. Which is probably one reason we have spent the last several generations stuck fighting at the national level about things that would be simply remedied by geography if left at the local level.</p>

<p>Why then, if you are a member of a disadvantaged community in a poor city or a poor state, don’t you simply pick up and move elsewhere? Why don’t we migrate our way out of destitution and division? It is a good question. Certainly many of the conditions that made such movement possible are no longer very common. The first condition is that of safety in numbers. To endure the hardships of migration, both physical, emotional, and economic, it’s good to be in a group. Most of us don’t have a ready-made group (at least one larger than a nuclear family) with whom we’d consider migrating to another town or state. The second reason is that the systems that serve us are location-based: many of us are theoretically free to move, but such a move may come at the cost of our jobs, our benefits, our state disability check. In short, not so free. Even most of our property is immobile: it is not such that we can put it in the back of the wagon and set up camp with along the side of a dusty trail. Finally, even if you had a modern-day caravan ready to move, where would you go to start anew? There are no more territories where you can claim your land grant and start from scratch. Your migration has very little chance of being able to find a place empty enough for you to build from the ground up. New developments are the bastion of mall and shopping center companies, not the work of human communities making a fresh start.</p>

<p>Perhaps this explains our confusion, our enflamed rhetoric when we fight to keep American like this, or prevent it from becoming like that. Perhaps we are a country of folks who used to enjoy getting a fire in our bellies and running out to the frontier to let it burn free, but now the frontier is full, so all we are left to do is stand still and argue. If good fences make good neighbors, maybe taking some space, learning to live and let live despite the close quarters, is the cure to the binds of moral conflict.</p>
