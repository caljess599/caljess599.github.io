  <p>Normalizing breastfeeding encourages women to try it and continue doing it, whereas keeping breastfeeding as a taboo thing, confusing it with the sexual purpose of breasts, means that women are embarrassed, they’re afraid to do it in public and they don’t nurse for that long or they choose not to nurse at all.</p>

<h3 id="boobs-and-babies">Boobs and Babies</h3>
<p>This public reminder that breasts have a “sexual purpose” has got to be the best news of last week. I groaned in bed when NPR reported the government-led violence in Syria and the passage in my new home state of a bill that will require voters to show picture ID at the polls. Such bad news in the morning made me all the more thrilled to hear that evening that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/us/marriage-ban-violates-constitution-court-rules.html">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld</a> (2-1) the California Supreme Court decision regarding the unconstitutionality of Proposition 8 (the referendum that changed the state constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage).</p>

<p>You’ll have to hold fast to your joy, though, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june12/prop8_02-07.html">as you listen to John Eastman</a> (from the National Organization for Marriage) defend the stance that there is no right to same-sex marriage because it is not procreative in the way of opposite-sex marriage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason [for reversal] would be the – the reason would be the right of the people to decide for themselves a very fundamental policy question about whether we’re going to continue to have an institution of marriage that is rooted in biology, with a purpose of procreation, as it always has been, or whether we’re going to allow the courts to mandate a dramatic alteration of that institution, with potentially devastating consequences to society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eastman’s invocation of biology is pretty sloppy—but also pretty crafty. It’s true that procreation requires the meetup of opposite-sex biological components (sperm and egg), but this necessity cannot and does not explain marriage, whose social significance is hardly exhausted by the procreation equation. While the benefits children receive from being raised in a stable, loving, two-parent household are demonstrable, it is laughable to posit that these advantages are inherent in the ‘biological’ procreative potential of man and woman. Even leaving aside the issue of the gender of the parents in question, where does this reductionism leave us in terms of marriages that are either beyond or beside the point of child-bearing and rearing? Is is too dangerous to recall God’s own reasoning in Genesis 2.18—”It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner”—lest it threaten to emphasize marital companionship over copulation?</p>

<p>In Eastman’s mouth, biology becomes a code word for ‘natural’—not that of Darwinian ‘natural selection’ but that of religious ‘natural law,’ scathingly described by <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/the-first-principles-of-rick-santorum/">Molly Worthen</a> on the <em>New York Times</em> website as ”philosophically reasoned prejudice.” Worthen writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evangelicals’ embrace of Santorum illuminates a crucial shift in American political culture: their honeymoon with the Tea Party seems to be over. They have turned away from the cries for small government and liberty—about which they have always been ambivalent—to rekindle their love affair with theocratic Catholicism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Worthen points out, the Tea Partiers’ cry for liberty and ‘strict construction’ of the Constitution was never libertarian in its intents. Rather, “it is an attempt to uncover the immutable, divine will of the Founders — a homegrown version of natural law that would provide grounds for forbidding abortion, same-sex marriage and ‘Obamacare’ in the name of American liberty.” A tenacious, immutable belief in these first principles is the source of Santorum’s otherwise entirely illogical arguments that a healthcare mandate or <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/rick-santorums-anti-college-rant/">the promotion of higher education</a> constitutes an affront to personal freedoms—and why outlawing birth control, abortion, and same-sex marriage does not.</p>

<p>Being against breast cancer is a failsafe position, safer perhaps even than being pro-parks, or pro-motherhood. Breasts are good, and cancer is bad—enough said. For a lesson in how to screw up something nearly screw-up proof, look no further than the example of the <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/">Susan G. Komen For the Cure</a>, the foundation that announced last week its intention to discontinue its grants to Planned Parenthood, ostensibly because they were cutting funding ties to all organizations under local, state or federal authorities. And besieged Planned Parenthood is indeed under a Congressional investigation, initiated by Representative Cliff Stearns, Republican of Florida, who feels it is a good use of government time and money to make sure that Planned Parenthood really and truly is complying with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment">Hyde Amendment</a>, the rider that has been routinely attached (since 1976!) to appropriation bills that mandates that no federal money go to abortion services.</p>

<p>The political implications of this decision hit Komen like a ton of bricks. The foundation was accused, and rightly so, of bowing to pressure from the anti-choice lobby. Websites and other anti-choice advocates have long criticized the foundation’s support of Planned Parenthood, despite the fact that Komen’s financial support funded only services related to breast health. But the pro-life pressure tactics turned out to be negligible compared to the fallout after the news of non-renewal became public. Donations to Planned Parenthood soared, the blogosphere roared, Congresspersons took notice, and few days later, Komen reversed itself.</p>

<p>This is good news for those who hate to see the anti-choice crowd bully organizations that have no stake in the abortion battle, but for the Komen foundation, the decision is pure pragmatism. Once they discovered that they were losing far more support from everyone else than they would be gaining by pleasing the anti-choice crowd, the reversal was the only logical option. The abortion issue remains divisive, but there is a definite consensus that it is wrong to politicize Komen’s connection to Planned Parenthood. Not only does the organization forward Komen’s mission, but it also provides many essential services to women who otherwise would not have access to them. Ultimately, the good will – and the cash – of this silent majority speaks louder than any protesters in pink.</p>

<p>I was catching up on <a href="http://www.nbc.com/the-voice/">The Voice</a> the other night when I found out that Whitney Houston had died at 48. At this rate, they ought to start a special ad campaign targeting singers: warning, drugs and alcohol are extremely likely to ruin your career and possibly take your life. I can remember seeing <em>The Bodyguard</em> with my parents when it came out – was it a Christmas movie or is that just my faulty memory? – and thinking how beautiful and talented Houston was, and how untouchable I thought that made her. I would have given useful appendages to be a star like she was. First Amy, now Whitney… The higher they rise, the harder they fall…</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of The Voice is that the initial auditions are blind, and thus the four judges make the decisions whether they would like the singer to join their team based entirely on what they hear. This is a fabulous way to encourage, to the extent that this is possible in today’s image-obsessed world, the separation between talent and looks. Adele and her <a href="http://www.thesundaily.my/news/293539">6 Grammy Awards last night</a>, anyone?</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but let’s not pretend that one of the show’s main attractions isn’t the prominently placed knockers of Christina Aguilera. As the only female judge, perhaps she has an extra responsibility to show cleavage. If so, she’s fulfilling that clause of the contract… to the letter DDD.</p>

<p>If Aguilera can be on national TV with that rack, I don’t see how we’re going to be ruined by snaps of suckling babes. Maybe if we can get Santorum to decry such photos as a liberal elitist plot to force women to breastfeed, Facebook would be humiliated into reversing its silliness.</p>

<p>Just nobody tell Rick that boobs have a sexual purpose, okay? Goodness knows what laws he’ll pass if he finds out!</p>
