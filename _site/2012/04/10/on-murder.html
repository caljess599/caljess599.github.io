<p>If you have no idea of the plot of this Barbara Stanwyck film from 1950, you’ll be pretty surprised to find out at the end of the opening scene that what is rotten in the state of suburban Illinois isn’t infidelity or loss of affection, but murder. The effect of that opening scene’s turn toward the noir is quasi comical; no sooner are we presented with the comfortable husband and wife, he with book, she with baby, in what appears to be a generic crisis of conjugal anomie than the voiceover takes us out of traditional melodrama and into film noir.</p>

<p>Murder, then, is at the heart of the film, and although I could very easily write an entire post about movie, instead I will take it as a jumping off point to compose a post I have been mulling over for a quite a while now about the evolution of murder shows on television.</p>

<p>Thanks to Netflix, it is now possible to relive many of our favorite shows minus the agony of advertising: nostalgia can perhaps be redefined as memory without commercial breaks. That comforting ritual that is the murder mystery, returns familiar but improved—the past is somehow brought back purer than ever in the midst of the relentless encroachment of advertising into every nook and cranny of our lives. Just this past week I’ve been listening to play-by-play baseball radio announcers seamlessly introduce ad copy into their calling of the game. Is nothing sacred?</p>
