<p>The other night I went to sleep with the news that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/us/politics/conservative-religious-leaders-seeking-unity-vote-to-back-rick-santorum.html?ref=politics">evangelical leaders had thrown their collective support behind former Senator Rick Santorum</a>’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The next morning I woke up to the news that former <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/01/15/145278213/officials-jon-huntsman-to-drop-presidential-bid">Governor Jon M. Huntsman, Jr. is dropping out of the race</a> and endorsing the current frontrunner, former Governor Mitt Romney. Though none of her eight readers will mistake Alice for a registered Republican, she did watch enough of the debates to come to the opinion that Huntsman represented the best possibile nominee from the absurd field of Republican candidates. He is intelligent, experienced, and credible; in short, he possesses qualities reminiscent of Republican contests from prelapsarian times – the fall surely being upon us already in 1988, when <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWXRNySMW4s">Lloyd Bentsen had to remind Dan Quayle</a> that he was no Jack Kennedy.</p>

<p>In the wake of these two events, it seems more urgent than ever to address the centrality of bigotry disguised as moral rectitude at the heart of Santorum’s campaign for leader of the free world. Yes, I know there is something inherently uncharitable in lending assistance to a <a href="http://spreadingsantorum.com/">vengeful dissemination</a> of the redefinition of a man’s last name into an unsavory, sexually explicit term, but I cannot resist, on both political and poetic grounds.</p>

<p>In case you live in a black hole impenetrable by salacious news, back in April 2003, then-Senator Rick Santorum did an interview with the Associated Press in which he elaborated on his views about the right to privacy, namely, that he believes that no such right exists in the Constitution. At the time, the Court was considering the case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas"><em>Lawrence v. Texas</em></a>, which dealt with the constitutionality of a Texas statute that criminalized consensual sex acts (including anal sex) between people of the same sex. In May that year, the Court ruled (6-3) that the Texas statute was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated due process guarantees. (Justice O’Connor voted with the majority, but wrote a concurring opinion in which she overturned the Texas law not on due process grounds, but those of equal protection.)</p>

<p>While Santorum’s constitutional views are common among those who favor allowing each state to determine the law with regard to such issues as abortion and same-sex marriage, what really upset gay rights activists was Santorum’s cavalier comparison of homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SANTORUM</strong>: We have laws in states, like the one at the Supreme Court right now, that has sodomy laws and they were there for a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family. And if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn’t exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution […] You say, well, it’s my individual freedom. Yes, but it destroys the basic unit of our society because it condones behavior that’s antithetical to strong healthy families. Whether it’s polygamy, whether it’s adultery, where it’s sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that’s what? Children. Monogamous relationships. In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That’s not to pick on homosexuality. It’s not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality —</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>AP</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t think I was going to talk about “man on dog” with a United States senator, it’s sort of freaking me out.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SANTORUM</strong>: And that’s sort of where we are in today’s world, unfortunately. The idea is that the state doesn’t have rights to limit individuals’ wants and passions. I disagree with that. I think we absolutely have rights because there are consequences to letting people live out whatever wants or passions they desire. And we’re seeing it in our society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response, the gay sex-columnist Dan Savage—who, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/infidelity-will-keep-us-together.html">despite his innovative views on what he considers an unhealthy American obsession with marital fidelity</a>, is very much pro-family, and has a son with his partner—ended up, at the suggestion of a reader, sponsoring a create-an-insult competition to permanently associate Santorum’s name with his anti-gay stance. The winning entry is the definition you see above. Oh, and it ~is~ was until very recently the first entry you see (below Santorum’s paid ad) <a href="http://searchengineland.com/how-rick-santorum-is-making-his-google-problem-worse-106665">when you google his name</a>.</p>

<p>I know repeating this gross insult on my blog violates the golden rule of doing to others as you would have done to you. Yet I choose to do so because there is something deeply satisfying about seeing a politician who would make his bigoted views against gays and lesbians a central aspect of his Presidential campaign get his cyberspace ‘cum’uppance. Bigots should be allowed their opinions and their rights to speak them openly should be protected. But they should also expect to be answered with equal venom.</p>

<h3 id="poetic-justice">Poetic, Justice</h3>
<p>It is important to note the care with which this winning definition was crafted. Here is the letter containing the suggestion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I agree with the spirit of naming something objectionable (to him) after Rick Santorum, I think it should be a substance, not an act. I would never want to “santorum” anyone I liked. What a turnoff. Instead, I think it would be better to name some kind of sexual byproduct after him. After all, ending up with idiots like Santorum in elected office is a byproduct of the otherwise desirable practice of letting any old yokel vote. Specifically, I nominate the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex. As in, “We had a great time, but we got santorum all over the sheets.” Or better yet, “Before I sodomize my gay, unmarried dog, I like to give him an enema so there won’t be any santorum.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the heart of this reader’s reasoning are two salient issues. First, the term must be offensive to Santorum but not to those who are expected to popularize it. In this sense, could be considered a sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation">reappropriation</a>, or rather, to neologize punningly, <em>fauxpropriation</em>. It is an ironic appropriation because, as the examples given by the suggester already make clear, the point is not to introduce a term to describe a substance, but rather to assign and popularize a convenient, derogatory shorthand for Rick Santorum’s anti-gay political platform.</p>

<p>Second, the term is coined in the spirit of the ambivalence of the principles and processes of democracy, an ambivalence that goes to the heart of the issues raised by the original controversy. In theory, letting each person have a vote is a good idea, because it allows each of us to feel represented and therefore somehow equally empowered. In practice, however—and historically there was a lot more anxiety about this—democracy is just a fancy word for mob rule. Indeed, there is no end of horrible things that the sacrosanct non-entity known as ‘the American people’ has believed in and voted for during the short lifespan of this unlikely republic.</p>

<p>This ambivalent <em>fauxpropriation</em> is the contemporary metamorphosis of the literary figure known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_justice">poetic justice</a>. The law of poetic justice demands that virtue be rewarded and evil punished. But the fact is, we no longer live in an age where we can all agree on the story we are telling, and thus what is virtue and what is vice. I have no qualms calling Rick Santorum a bigot because he believes that homosexual acts and gay marriage should be illegal in states where the residents prefer that it be so. Not only does he not care that I call him a bigot, on his <a href="http://www.ricksantorum.com/champion-faith-families">campaign website</a> he anticipates that I will do so, and wears it as a badge of honor, labeling me with the appropriate corresponding epithet—liberal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When activist judges took it upon themselves to redefine marriage, and with it the underpinnings of the traditional American family and our First Amendment right to Freedom of Religion, Rick spearheaded the debate in favor of Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004. Rick successfully fought even members of his own Party and had the amendment brought to the Senate floor for public debate in two successive Congresses. Even though he knew he would be labeled a bigot or worse by members of the liberal elite, Rick Santorum understood this issue was far too important to the future of our society not to be debated before the American public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From an evangeliconservative viewpoint, risking the label of bigotry is the sign of courage of a true defender of American values against liberals who espouse a dangerous live-and-let-live philosophy, and the activist judges who would impose this philosophy on everyone else. If the waters aren’t muddied enough already, consider another exchange in that same <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm">2003 interview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re saying that liberalism is taking power away from the families, how is conservatism giving more power to the families?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SANTORUM:</strong> Putting more money in their pocketbook is one. The more money you take away from families is the less power that family has.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is something downright bizarre about Santorum’s entirely uncynical embrace of money as the force of good in this country. And it is absolutely mind-boggling how this promiscuous attitude toward wealth has wound up in such a tight embrace with pseudo-Puritan attitudes about sex. But this is what conservatism is these days, unless you are Ron Paul (who is only a conservative when it comes to getting on TV—really he’s a libertarian). Santorum, like his fellow conservatives, is all for the free, unfettered flow of money, as if it is a magical, moral fluid. Money is a way we can express and empower ourselves without fear of excess or decadence. The more money, the better, not only to each family, but also (as we are now seeing) in the form of ‘free speech’ in political campaigns. The bonus with Santorum is that he understands the importance not only of cutting your taxes, but also of restoring morality by taking away your birth control. Yes, you read that right—he believes that even for married people, non-procreative sex is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2011/10/19/348007/rick-santorum-pledges-to-defund-contraception-its-not-okay-its-a-license-to-do-things/?mobile=nc">counter to the way things are supposed to be</a>. And the way things are “supposed to be” is what, Rick—<a href="http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/19-kids-and-counting">19 Kids and Counting</a>?</p>

<h3 id="slippery-slopes">Slippery slopes</h3>
<p>With more money for all and ejaculate safely squirting into the conjugal vaginas of fertile women, America will rise again. This is so ridiculous that to call this attitude conservative, in the sense of returning to a slate of old values, would be to insult more dead people than I dare. The Duggars have nothing in common with colonial Puritans; the Quiverfull <em>lifestyle choice</em> (!) they exemplify is only possible in an age of modern medicine and Child Tax Credits.  (And did you know, Rick, that the ‘father’ of this country, George Washington, was himself sterile, and never had any genetic offspring?)</p>

<p>It is easy to mistake Santorum’s ‘conservative’ stance as traditional, however, because Christianity (or those perhaps who speak most loudly in its name) has historically condemned homosexuality. (Please note: I am not picking on Christianity or Christians here. There are plenty of Christian denominations that do not condemn gays and lesbians; there are other religions that do condemn homosexuality. Furthermore, there are members of all religions who, despite the dogma of their chosen faith, are not homosexist.) But Rick Santorum is not taking us back to the 1920s, the 1620s, or any time in between. Even Dante, to roll back to the 1320s, would recognize neither the postmodern cult of extreme liquidity nor that of extreme fertility. In his version of hell, sodomites are punished along with the usurers – the former sinning against nature (God’s offspring), the latter against industry and economy (nature’s offspring, so God’s grandchildren). Dante was strict all the way around; these days, Santorum and his brethren seem way more eager to decry gay marriage than to condemn the rapacity and corruption on Wall Street. Am I the only one to think that Wall Street, not same-sex coupledom, is responsible for the mess of our economy?</p>

<p>Maybe it is because Dante is long dead that I don’t think of him a homosexist – or, for that matter, an anti-Semite, both of which he probably was, in perfect concert with his time and place. Really, I don’t think of him as anything except a poet, even though he was what we liberal elites would call <em>engagé</em>. He cared deeply about the temporal society in which he lived, and he had, needless to say, very strong opinions. (It really doesn’t get much stronger than putting people you disagree with into a graphically detailed infernal afterlife.)</p>

<p>Instead, when I was summarizing the etymology of the new meaning of santorum for my cousin, the word I reached for was one I learned while studying the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. For the spreading of santorum is a lovely contemporary example of <em>contrapasso</em>, that is, of an appropriate correspondence between sin on earth and punishment in hell. Here, of course, I fauxpropriate the term, as I am condemning not men who love men, or women who love women, but people who would condemn them for doing so.</p>

<p>And the only uncomfortable eternity to which I sentence Santorum is the unforgiving memory of Google.</p>
