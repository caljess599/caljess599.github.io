<p><em>The Artist</em> tells a poignant love story set against the changing world of Hollywood in the 1920s and 30s. This May-August romance between Peppy Miller and George Valentin begins accidentally, as the unknown Peppy steals George’s spotlight after a movie premiere. The next day, as her photograph is all over the papers, she gets herself cast as an extra in George’s latest formula flick, “A German Affair.” While the script calls for him to briefly dance with her, we see in take after take the evolution of a mutual feeling between them, something undefined but powerful.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://twcguilds.com/assets/screenplay/the-artist.pdf">the script</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scene is shot several times from three different angles. Each time, George dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport changes. To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then, with time, less so. Then they become embarrassed, and then things get worse. We start the sequence again and again, to the sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes, but the eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from the scene, every thing else goes unnoticed. Ultimately, no flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing. It’s probably love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peppy’s reveals her feelings in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmPt9il-Tdo">brilliant scene that follows</a>. (Make sure you have the volume up to hear the music.) Not finding George in his dressing room, she sees his coat and top hat on the coat rack. Placing her arm through one sleeve, her arm seems to become his arm, and she proceeds to expertly pantomime—and respond to—what appears to be his hand caressing her. Wordlessly, she has conveyed her longing; alone, she has expressed the erotic charge between herself and the man she desires—a message not lost on George who then enters the room.</p>

<p><em>The Artist</em> is a silent film, but it is mindfully and purposefully silent, retrofitting (literally) this genre for the purposes of metacinematic commentary. References to the act of talking abound, be it in the context of refusal or inability to speak, or a need or a wish to talk, or in the literal context of the technological change at the core of the film: the advent of the talkies. Though the world of film brings Peppy and George together, it also soon divides them, as Peppy begins to rise through the ranks at Kinograph Studios, which has just ceased production on silent films—as they were suddenly retronymically named—to devote itself to the talkies, the obvious future of the industry. George is accordingly let go from Kinograph, thus ending the possibility of collaboration between himself and his might-be sweetheart (he’s married, but not too happily).</p>

<p>At first, George fails to read the writing on the wall—after he is let go by Kinograph, he pours his own money into a film of his own direction, determined that he can still draw the crowds. Both his “Tears of Love” and Peppy’s first major film, “Beauty Spot,” are scheduled to open on Friday, October 25. But in the wake of the Wall Street Crash (beginning Oct. 24, 1929, “Black Thursday”), the lines are for Peppy Miller’s talkie rather than George’s retro opus. While George’s public abandons him, dismissing him as part of the past, Peppy remains loyal, watching the film in an empty theater and stopping by his house to tell him how much she enjoyed it. She is the exception, however, as Peppy’s companion explains that his father was George’s fan, rather than him. Even George enjoys the innovation of the talkies, later watching Peppy as “The Guardian Angel” in a packed theater. (It’s rather curious to watch an audience watch a talkie in a silent film; the internal audience ‘hears’ while we do not, and we suddenly appreciate that certain aspects of cinema are actually lost with the innovation of recorded audio.)</p>

<h3 id="words-unspoken">Words unspoken</h3>
<p>When his wife Doris declares she’s had enough (“We have to talk,” goes that dreaded line, both sad and comic in this context), George’s bust is complete—he is passé, broke, and headed toward divorce. Told by Doris to pack his things and go, he spirals into poverty and depression, drowning his sorrows in drink. Soon he can no longer afford to keep his old furniture or the collectables relating to his career, and must auction them all off. His self-pity increasing in proportion to his desperation, he forcibly dismisses his aging butler-chauffeur, Clifton, who has loyally remained with him despite not having been paid for an entire year.</p>

<p>Alone (save for his adorable Jack Russell, Jack) and embittered, George hits bottom one day watching his own movies in his empty apartment. George flies into a rage and begins to break open the cans of film (the only thing he seems to have kept) and crazily unspools the reels. In a sea of celluloid, he then lights a match. As anyone who has seen <em>Cinema Paradiso</em> will recall, old film was extremely flammable, and so we understand that George is suicidal. Indeed, as the fire soon rages out of control, he crawls into the corner to die.</p>

<p>Jack, appreciating the danger and unable to coax George to flee with his barking, runs down the street and manages (with the help of a passing woman) to convince the corner policeman to follow him and rescue his master. In the hospital, where Peppy rushes from the set as soon as she hears the news, she recognizes the one reel of film that George saved from the flames as the outtakes from “A German Affair”—the only footage of them together.</p>

<p>She moves the still-sleeping George to her mansion to continue his recovery. His pride, however, makes him a grudging recipient of her kindness, even though Clifton—who now works for Peppy, of course—attempts to convince him of her well-meaningness when he delivers a script from her. This movie, which Peppy has blackmailed Zimmer into agreeing to, will co-star George. But George is too determined to feel bad for himself to even read the script, and once he discovers that Peppy was the purchaser of all his goods at auction, he leaves in a fury.</p>

<p>Back in his burned-out apartment, George removes a gun from its box to finally kill himself. Peppy, however, arrives in time to convince him to accept the possibility of his own redemption. For <em>The Artist</em> is precisely a film of redemption, in the sense of continuity and recuperation. George is convinced that the technological change of the talkies has rendered him a failure, having destroyed his fame and also his personal value, even his worthiness of being loved. Peppy finally convinces George that far from being washed up and unlovable, the present (meaning both her and the world of the talkies) does not demand anything of him that he is not. George does not need to learn to do what we are repeatedly shown he cannot do—find his voice. In other words, he does not need to change himself, he need only drop his attitude of pride and self-pity in order to embrace—as Peppy has always done—who he already is.</p>

<h3 id="words-left-unsaid">Words left unsaid</h3>
<p>Although Peppy and George have felt strong feelings for one another from the beginning, this love is never openly declared in words, not even during the dramatic rescue scene near the movie’s end. Instead, Peppy tells George she feels awful that he has taken her actions so badly: she confesses that she merely wanted to help him, to care for him. They embrace, but that is as romantic as the language gets. Which is fitting, not only for the expectations of the time period (this is, wink wink, the 1930s), but also for their relationship, which has itself developed largely in separation and in silence, rather than amidst the drama-filled wordiness of contemporary communication. Peppy makes no confessions of love, but simply serves George through her kindness, supporting him anonymously by buying his possessions and nursing him after the fire.</p>

<p>Accordingly, George’s redemption—and the film’s happy ending—comes from a different source than that of today’s typical romantic comedy. This latter is often predicated on a fallacious fantasy: the heroine gets her formerly reprobate man after her love motivates him to reform. (A recent decent movie based on this premise is <em>Crazy. Stupid. Love</em>. A less-recent and stunningly awful movie based on this premise is <em>Something Borrowed</em>.) In <em>The Artist</em>, Peppy never demands that George change to merit her, as he has never wronged her, only himself. Instead of demanding, Peppy perseveres—not so that George can change, but so that he can awaken.</p>

<p>George, in accepting Peppy’s help, accepts the possibility that there is still a place for him on the silver screen: no longer as the independent hero, but as the dance partner of Peppy—dancing being, as we have seen, something they both do terrifically well. As the film concludes with a take of their tap number, suddenly the audio is added, and the first sound we hear is the lovers’ labored breath, as both Peppy and George are winded from the effort. (Another hint, perhaps, that a tap dance is truly the early-movie-era substitute for the love scene, as noted by director Michel Hazanavicius in a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2011/12/05/111205ta_talk_friend">brief interview in 5 Dec. 2011’s New Yorker</a>.) As the film emerges for the first time into a full-audio world—and in the context of making a movie, no less!—we realize that in a very important sense, there was never any such thing as the world of silent film, as stage sets both then and now are full of sound. The retronym seems more a technical term describing a recording process than an aesthetic description of an actor’s or filmgoer’s experience.</p>

<p>Like George and Peppy, we have heard all that is necessary in our hearts.</p>
