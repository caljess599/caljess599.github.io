<blockquote>
  <p>Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts. Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with representations and ceremonies. […] An opulent priest is a contradiction. The priest must keep close to the poor. Now, can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all these misfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one’s own person a little of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair, nor blackened nails, nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face? The first proof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty. This is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D– thought.</p>

<h3 id="the-longest-war">The longest war</h3>
<p>Last month in <em>The New York Times</em><!--more-->, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/why-cant-we-end-poverty-in-america.html">Peter Edelman penned an op-ed piece about poverty</a>, specifically, about why it has been so difficult to eradicate in America, the wealthiest nation on earth.</p>

<p>Edelman’s diagnosis regarding the persistence of poverty will come as no surprise to liberals: there are too many low-wage jobs, wages in such low-earning jobs remain stagnant, and relief programs that keep people out of poverty (i.e., welfare) have been scaled back or eliminated. Certainly there has been economic growth in recent decades, and even in recent years, but its benefits have been almost exclusively confined to the top income earners, the now infamous 1%.</p>

<p>The attitude behind Edelman’s outlook is that capitalism makes some rich and leaves others poor; the role of government is thus to counteract the latter effect through a redistribution of wealth. From this perspective, poverty is understood intuitively as a negative outcome that society has an obligation to combat.</p>

<p>To the extent that this view presumes that poverty is a matter for the state to address, it is a political view of poverty. But it is not just the supporters of the safety net who fall into this category. Even those who view the New Deal as the disastrous encroachment of the dreaded Welfare State are still thinking politically: they think that political interference <em>promotes</em> poverty by discouraging self-reliance (and by restraining economic growth).</p>

<p>The consequence of this political attitude is that the nature of poverty itself goes unexamined. Nature of poverty, you say? Isn’t that obvious? <em>No one wants to be poor</em>. But this reaction is, I would suggest, the result of such a political attitude rather than its cause. Poverty is presumed to be the proof of bad policy – the policy of the other party, of course—and as such, the state of poverty is presumed to be horrible and unnatural.</p>

<p>Surely, the misery of not being able to meet one’s basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, and medical care is not negligible. But the notion of deprivation can hardly account for the prevailing attitude toward poverty as something to be battled against and defeated. Deprivation and misfortune are as old as human existence itself – much, much older than the view that poverty is eliminable. The constant references in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament to the poor implies (to me, anyway) that poverty was once viewed a mere fact of human existence; the constant monitions and reminders to aid the unfortunate were not political in nature, but entirely social. Aiding the poor was simply a matter of course, as natural as the existence of poor people themselves. In this sense, there was no “poverty,” just as there was no reified notion of “combating poverty.”</p>

  <p>The question is not whether we wish to see everybody as well off as possible. Among men of good will such an aim can be taken for granted. The real question concerns the proper means of achieving it. And in trying to answer this we must never lose sight of a few elementary truisms. We cannot distribute more wealth than is created. We cannot in the long run pay labor as a whole more than it produces. —Henry Hazlitt, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Economics-One-Lesson-Shortest-Understand/dp/0517548232"><em>Economics in One Lesson</em></a> <em>(ch. XIX, part 3)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of my recovery from blind-faith liberalism, I’m reading books that have me shaking more than nodding my head. One of these is Hazlitt’s classic 1946 primer on laissez-faire Austrian school economics, <em>Economics in One Lesson</em>.</p>

<p>Hazlitt takes us through the many economic regulations we have come to take for granted – tariffs, farm subsidies, government-backed mortgages, unemployment insurance, rent control, minimum wages laws, etc. — and explains (sometimes more, sometimes less convincingly) why they all amount to no more than robbing Peter (the taxpayer) to pay Paul (the unemployed, the poor, the struggling farmer, the nascent industrialist). He calls this kind of misdirection of money “malinvestment.”</p>

<p>Although Hazlitt understands how being out of work can be a personal tragedy for the person and family of the unemployed, he still does not see a real benefit to taking money from other people who are employed (via taxation) and “creating” a job for this person. For Hazlitt, such “make-work” schemes lend the appearance of enriching the nation but actually just divert wealth that could have been spent by individuals rather than the government. Take the example of building an unnecessary bridge with tax dollars.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[F]or every public job created by the bridge project a private job has been destroyed somewhere else. We can see the men employed on the bridge. We can watch them at work.  The employment argument of the government spenders becomes vivid, and probably for most people convincing. But there are other things that we do not see, because, alas, they have never been permitted to come into existence. They are the jobs destroyed by the $10 million taken from the taxpayers. All that has happened, at best, is that there has been a <em>diversion</em> of jobs because of the project. More bridge builders; fewer automobile workers, television technicians, clothing workers, farmers. <em>(ch. IV, part 1)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although you’d have to be naive to believe that America is going to recover from the Great Recession by building more cars (we’re lucky to be building any), repairing TVs (!!), making more clothes, or returning to the farm, the case against government spending that Hazlitt makes here at first appears to be that put forward by Mitt Romney and the Republican Party in their attempt to unseat President Obama this November. Cut taxes, Romney says, and economic prosperity will return – the true “job creators” (capitalists) will go back to hiring. To which the Obama campaign says, “we tried that approach, that’s how we got into this mess!”</p>

<h3 id="les-misérables">Les Misérables</h3>
<p>But there is a crucial difference between Hazlitt’s arguments and Romney’s throwback belief in trickle-down economics—and, once again, it comes down to a political versus a social understanding of poverty.</p>

<p>In the final pages of the book, Hazlitt writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under a system of division of labor… it is difficult to think of a greater fulfillment of any human need which would not, at least temporarily, hurt some of the people who have made investments or painfully acquired skill to meet that precise need. If progress were completely even all around the circle, this antagonism between the interests of the whole community and of the specialized group would not, if it were noticed at all, present any serious problem. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But economic progress never has taken place and probably never will take place in this completely uniform way. […] And if there is a sudden increase in the supply of the thing I help to produce, or if a new invention or discovery makes what I produce no longer necessary, then the gain to the world is a tragedy to me and to the productive group to which I belong. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is altogether proper—it is, in fact, essential to a full understanding of the problem – that the plight of these groups be recognized, that they be dealt with sympathetically, and that we try to see whether some of the gains from this specialized progress cannot be used to help the victims find a productive role elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the solution is never to reduce supplies arbitrarily, to prevent further inventions or discoveries, or to support people for continuing to perform a service that has lost its value. […] This is the insane doctrine of wealth through scarcity. (Ch. XXV, part 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Hazlitt does not discuss the role of charity in the economy, his insistence on the “insanity” of purposefully creating scarcity seems to point in the same direction as the Bible’s instructions on gleaning: namely, toward the necessary allowance of an abundance (or surplus) that cannot — and should not — be regulated. While he may seem to take a harsh line on people put out of work by evolving technology, Hazlitt would also be against paying farmers <em>not to farm</em> in order to prop up the price of crops. In short, Hazlitt believes in the free market not simply because of his faith in prosperity, but also because of his knowledge of tragedy.</p>

<p>Mitt Romney, on the other hand, looks out across the spacious skies and sees only the inevitable prosperity of those waves of grain thwarted by failed Democratic policies. He beholds the busts and bubble-bursts but refuses to see the tragedy at the heart of market-based capitalism that Hazlitt bravely describes. No, Romney sees only the absence of a guiding, invisible hand—his own. In short, he believes in economic magic, a viewpoint (non-coincidentally) <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2011/10/0083637">essential to his Mormon faith</a>—and one that (undoubtedly) has been reinforced by his personal success. (And what Victor Hugo has to say about that!)</p>

<p>Regardless of what you think of supply-side economics, it is Romney’s overactive positive mind that, in my humble opinion, disqualifies him to be President. Give me a tragedian over a magician anytime, as the former is much closer to the <em>misérables</em> in our midst.</p>
