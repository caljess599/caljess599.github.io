  <p>The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To those who would argue that “personal” rights are more sacrosanct than “property” rights, the short answer is that the Constitution makes no such distinction. To the argument made by Thurgood Marshall that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, in the long run it is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minority are.</p>

<h3 id="a-house-divided">A House Divided</h3>
<p>Among historic presidential houses, James Madison’s <a href="http://www.montpelier.org/">Montpelier</a> is somewhat of an outlier. While its nearby confederates Monticello and Mount Vernon both experienced periods of abandonment and disrepair before their respective renaissances, the 22-room house at Montpelier was built up into a 55-room, 12-bath mansion by the duPont family, following their purchase of the property in 1901.</p>

<p>Thus when it came time, over eight decades later, to restore the house to its presidential, pre-duPont state, the project was a kind of archeology excavation – the team literally had to dismantle the new structure piece by piece in search of Madison’s house under and within it. The result is simply unbelievable, and the metaphor is not inappropriate for Madison’s intense and thorough investigation of forms of government throughout history that he used to inform his drafting of the Virginia Plan. You can now sit in what was Madison’s library and watch an informative video while you imagine all of his books crowding around him as he formulated what would become the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>The Bill of Rights is a document that exemplifies the fundamental “shall not” nature that is at the heart of limited government, which was certainly a guiding principle for Madison.   A good federal government, as Madison understood it, was one that did as little as needed to accomplish its primary goal, which was the success of the Union. From that perspective, it is easy enough to understand the protections of the Bill of Rights as a continuation of the status quo, not an expansion of rights to new groups (e.g., slaves, the unpropertied, women).</p>

<p>The best thing that the federal government could do for Madison was stay out of his way. This is largely because Madison was at the top of the social and economic pyramid –  he was a propertied, slave-owning white male. But it is worth recalling that the world was also a different place. Madison spent his final years as an invalid, but he didn’t incur huge hospital bills. He didn’t fight with his insurance company. He was cared for – the way he was always cared for – by his household, including his slaves. It was a society based on labor arrangements that were as unjust as they were personal and enduring. Into this intimate world, into this world where power relationships were ultra-localized and irremediable, it would have been impossible to imagine the intervention of the federal government.</p>

<p>For Madison, then, any group that threatens to upset this local focus constitutions a faction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A faction can be a majority or a minority – Madison is under no illusion that the opinion that is most widely held should be therefore the rule of the day. Indeed, if nothing else, he views government as a tool to preserve the natural differences in the faculties of men and the varied relationships to property that result therefrom. Community in this sense has nothing to do with majority rule, and everything to do with non-interference in established power structures.</p>

<h3 id="majority-rules">Majority rules</h3>
<p>Society as Madison knew it would be entirely destroyed by the Civil War – the ultimate act of interference with the establishment – and supplanted by a nascent industrial society. It is this historical juncture to which we can trace the foundations of today’s domination-by-corporation. Out of the reluctant realization that slaves were people slowly emerged the compensatory hallucination that corporations were so, too. Indeed, as I’ve mentioned before, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, business interests sought relief on the grounds of the 14th Amendment far more frequently than did African Americans.</p>

<p>In this radically different contemporary context, any discussion of limited government must be of an entirely another sort than that which Madison was having with his learned tomes. To me, the desperate cry for the government to shrink down and slink away and leave us alone smacks of closing the barn door after the horse has bolted. After all, there is no longer anything limited about our personal entanglements with huge entities: huge corporations make everything from our phones to our prescription drugs, and other huge corporations pay our salaries, extend us credit, and ration our access to affordable medical care. Whatever you think of big government, its rise has largely paralleled the rise of big corp.</p>

<p>It is that symbiosis that gives rise to the peculiar current debate (legal and popular) over the Affordable Care Act. <a href="http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-rachel-maddow-show/46887349#46887424">Listen to Rachel Maddow</a>(skip to 3:35) explain how although crowds rant and rave about the evil Obamacare, when people are asked about the main elements of the law itself (rather than about ‘Obamacare’), folks of all political stripes overwhelming support them.</p>

<p>On the legal front, the respondents in <em>Dept. of Health and Human Services v. Florida</em> are maintaining that the free-market solution the law enacts to the health care crisis has at its heart an unconstitutional mandate to buy health insurance. While (as Justice Kennedy observed) it would be perfectly legal to construct a single-payer system, it is an entirely different matter for the government to insist that any consumer purchase something—even if hospitals are obligated to provide care regardless of a patient’s insurance status or ability to pay. The oddity—or, if you will concede to the colloquial usage of the term, this irony—that Congress crafted a law that favored a market-based solution (the same one proposed by conservatives at the time of Hillary Clinton’s attempts at healthcare reform) that is being attacked as unconstitutional did not go unremarked by Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/28/us/28scotus-transcript.html?ref=us">in his oral arguments on March 27</a> (p. 25).</p>

<p>From the standpoint of progressives who favor a single-payer system, Obamacare is actually a give-away to the insurance companies, for it enshrines their unsustainable model as federal law. A thoughtful friend of mine, who gave up his own blog years ago, summed up the situation thus: Obamacare is More Cowbell – it may expand coverage, but, because it falls short of radical change, it won’t do very much to address the root causes of escalating health care costs. While the government can set its reimbursement rates and thus restrain costs, the equivalent force in the market is open competition. So if you aren’t going to go the single-payer route, you’d be better off with increased competition rather than mandated participation. As we’ve proved with the deregulation of telephony and airfares, open competition tends to radically lower costs.</p>

<h3 id="minority-report">Minority report</h3>
<p>Shortly before the Supreme Court heard arguments in the <em>Dept. of Health v. Florida</em>, an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/us/new-look-at-an-old-memo-casts-more-doubt-on-rehnquist.html">article in the New York Times</a>reported on recent developments in a story from the Court’s past. In 1952, William H. Rehnquist <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST/pdf/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST-4-16-6.pdf">wrote a memo about the segregation cases</a> (including the iconic <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>) then pending before the Court. Rehnquist denied—both at his initial confirmation hearing in 1971 and again in 1986 when he was nominated for the position of Chief Justice—that this memo reflected his views, insisting that he wrote it in the voice of the judge for whom he was then clerking, Robert H. Jackson. As the Times reports, <a href="http://bclawreview.org/review/53_2/05_snyder_barrett/">new research</a> lends further support to the argument that the opinions in the memo were indeed Rehnquist’s own.</p>

<p>In this memo, Rehnquist argues that the high court cannot hope for any historical continuity if it intervenes on questions of treatment of minority groups by majorities. Citing the unusually quick reversal of opinion in the <a href="http://www.sunnylandsclassroom.org/Downloads/ACBooks/Pursuit%20of%20Justice/Chapters/85-92_Ch.10.pdf">Jehovah’s Witness flag salute cases</a>, in which the court overruled its 1940 decision in 1943, Rehnquist predicted that any court tempted to interfere in these such matters would find its rulings made irrelevant by the passage of time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One hundred and fifty years of attempts on the part of this Court to protect minority rights of any kind— whether those of business, slaveholders, or Jehovah’s Witnesses—have been sloughed off, and crept silently to rest. If the present Court is unable to profit by this example it must be prepared to see its work fade in time, too, as embodying only the sentiments of a transient majority of nine men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Rehnquist recognizes that it would be the compassionate thing to do to vote to overrule state-mandated segregation, he doesn’t believe that it is the proper role of the Court.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by “liberal” colleagyes <em>[sic]</em>, but I think <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> was right and should be re-affirmed. If the fourteenth Amendment did not enact Spencer’s Social Statios <em>[sic]</em>, it just as surely did not enact Myrddahl’s <em>[sic]</em> American Dilemna <em>[sic]</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What could be right about <em>Plessy</em>, the now infamous decision from 1896 that upheld Jim Crow? Here is a critical passage from <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/163/537/case.html">the <em>Plessy</em> decision</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff’s argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it. The argument necessarily assumes that if, as has been more than once the case and is not unlikely to be so again, the colored race should become the dominant power in the state legislature, and should enact a law in precisely similar terms, it would thereby relegate the white race to an inferior position. We imagine that the white race, at least, would not acquiesce in this assumption. The argument also assumes that social prejudices may be overcome by legislation, and that equal rights cannot be secured to the negro except by an enforced commingling of the two races. We cannot accept this proposition. If the two races are to meet upon terms of social equality, it must be the result of natural affinities, a mutual appreciation of each other’s merits, and a voluntary consent of individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However far-fetched, willful and racist this passage may read to modern eyes, it enshrines a principle of non-interference that Rehnquist holds dear in quixotic quest (nine <em>men</em>?) to mould the Court into more than a representative body of its time and place. The rightness of <em>Plessy</em> and the grounds on which separate but equal should be upheld, apparently has to do with a refusal to believe that the law can or should create social truths.</p>

<p>In this memo, Rehnquist refers to two books of social theory in his call to keep the Fourteenth Amendment clear of any such interpretations. The first, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Statics">Herbert Spencer’s 1851 tome Social Statics</a>, is a libertarian prequel to the author’s later work in which he would coin the phrase “survival of the fittest”. This is not a chance mention, but rather a reference to the Court’s own history, specifically Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.’s dissent in the landmark case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York"><em>Lochner v. New York</em></a>, a 1905 case in which the majority ruled that a New York labor law restricting the maximum work hours of bakers interfered with their liberty to contract. Holmes famously quipped that “the Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s <em>Social Statics</em>.” Rehnquist here is expanding on Holmes’ remark by referring to the 1944 study by Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal on U.S. race relations, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Dilemma">An American Dilemma</a>. His point is that just as the Fourteenth Amendment shouldn’t be co-opted by laissez-fair proponents in order to overturn state legislation, nor should it be, in his opinion, co-opted by “liberals” against segregation to overturn state-enshrined Jim Crow.</p>

<p>Whether one views the long aftermath of the <em>Brown</em> decision hopefully or cynically, it is nevertheless of great comfort that separate but equal is no longer the <em>law</em> of the land. Rehnquist may be right that no court can alter the hearts of men, but there can be no doubt that the legal principle of <em>stare decisis</em> is a foreign concept to the workings of history, which undulates forward as surely as the world turns. As the needless death of Trayvon Martin makes clear, race relations in this country are still fraught with tension, tension that can too easily escalate into deadly violence. (And yet notice how there is <em>no</em> mention of gun control in the aftermath… ah, Florida…) While the prejudices that sparked the suspicions of Zimmerman are unfortunately widespread, it wasn’t so long ago that the result of such an encounter would have been not the shot of one misguided housing development vigilante’s gun, but a mob lynching. (Not to mention the fact that a Hispanic man with a Jewish last name might have then proved an equally attractive target for the assaults of prejudice.) To Trayvon’s family and friends, this circumstance makes no difference, for a young man is dead. But to the community as a whole, and to history at large, it makes all the difference in the world.</p>
