<blockquote>The gift that Bella gave me was the gift of looking at this disabled child who in the world's view will never be able to do anything for me other than love me. She is just a font of love as far as I'm concerned. And she made me understand that that's how the Father looks at me, disabled. Unable to do anything for him except love him. And he loves me unconditionally.</blockquote>

<h3>Your attention please...</h3>
<p>Having spent the vast majority of last week ill with a bad cold, Alice’s loyal fans might suspect the mind-altering effects of cold medicine (ah, Claritin, drug of the gods!) behind this announcement: I think everything I want to say about modern culture, I can say in terms of Rick Santorum.</p>

<p>Undeniably, my blogging obsession with this former Senator has been looming for several fortnights, but it was <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/super-pac-super-bad" target="_blank">David Brooks’s banter with Gail Collins</a> in the first print version of their online “Conversation” series that I think really put me over the top. David writes:</p>
<blockquote>The odd thing is that Santorum seems to be enjoying all this. That's in part because he has a tropism for the tragic. Most of us look past bad events. We want life to look like our photo albums — a bunch of happy faces, editing out all the bad times. But Santorum seems to dwell on misfortune — the enemies the country faces, the depravity closing in on us, the unfair criticism hurled against him, the terrible things that have happened. When the campaign goes into its fallen state, he has the pleasure of seeing his tragic worldview confirmed.</blockquote>
<p>Santorum, the anti-Jack Kennedy Catholic, has a tragic world view? Tragic? Woah. This is big. This is really big. Why, you ask, is this big? Well, mostly because I have devoted a large percentage of my grey matter’s energy over several years to understanding what tragedy means in the modern period, and thus it is no small matter that it is now coalescing, in real time, into what it (classically speaking) was defined against: the salvation of eternal life promised by Christianity.</p>

<p>So my Santorum obsession finally makes sense to me… It’s not just the outrage, it’s not just the fun factor that he represents as the unelectable G.O.P. spoiler. It’s more than that. It’s about larger ideas, ideas to which I have given much thought both in this blog and elsewhere. It might even be a book… I wonder if, when he’s done with the campaign trail, Santorum would grant me an interview? Ah, that really must be the cold medicine making me dream big…</p>
<h3>Unclean until evening</h3>
<blockquote>This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. [...] For the unclean they shall take some ashes of the burnt purification offering, and running water shall be added in a vessel; then a clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the furnishings, on the persons who were there, and on whoever touched... the corpse. The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean ones on the third day and on the seventh day, thus purifying them on the seventh day. Then they shall wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and at evening they shall be clean. [...] It shall be a perpetual statute for them. The one who sprinkles the water for cleansing shall wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water for cleansing shall be unclean until evening.</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">--Numbers 19.14, 17-19, 21</p>
<p>The President of the United States has frequently been referred to as the most powerful man on earth. That may perhaps be less true now that America is in a bit of a slump, but nevertheless, the occupier of the American presidency has the temporal authority and resources of few others. Therefore it is perhaps all the more strange to find that one of the men seeking this office this year has a theological world view in which he is cast as profoundly powerless; in fact, the term he uses is rather provocative – it is the term “disabled.”</p>

<p>The history of this term, and the idea the term represents, is diverse and complex. A wonderful book on this subject is that by Henri-Jacques Stiker’s, originally published in French in 1997, but now available in English as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Disability-Corporealities-Discourses/dp/047208626X" target="_blank">A History of Disability</a>. Stiker attempts to paint in broad strokes the general feelings of many ages and cultures around the notion of individual difference within human society, and the book offers a tremendous view into the vastly different ways that human cultures have understood such differences.</p>

<p>This post allows me the space merely to present an example, but I hope it is illustrative of the larger possibilities of this sort of inquiry. In his parallel of the general human condition to that of his disabled child, Santorum is essentializing the notion of disability; he is making it a fundamental attribute of his existence that is not subject to alteration, either by time or through treatment. Leaving aside the many implications of that view, let us note how different this is from the notion of uncleanliness described in the Torah. The foundational books of the Torah reiterate the need to protect the holiness of the encampment of Israel, and in order to do so provides detailed instructions on how to remove uncleanliness from both persons and objects.</p>

<p>If one looks beyond an obsession with bodily emissions and skin imperfections that might seem ignorant to a scientific mind (let alone a feminist one), the remarkable fact (at least it strikes me as so) that remains is the extent to which the return of cleanliness is represented in the most basic turnover of all – the daily setting of the sun. Against this background of the constant resetting of the state of cleanliness, the notion of holiness seems suddenly much more about the efforts of daily reality rather than a fundamental, inalterable state of purity – or defilement. Holiness is like any other aspect of human life, subject to natural risks and responsive to known recourses.</p>
<h3>Presidential Grief</h3>
<p>In her probing post entitled “<a href="http://contemporarycondition.blogspot.com/2012/02/making-sense-of-rick-santorum.html" target="_blank">Making Sense of Rick Santorum</a>,” Kathy Ferguson (Political Science, University of Hawaii, Manoa) identifies Santorum’s public display and discussion of the grief over the loss of his stillborn son, Gabriel, as what distinguishes his anti-abortion stance from similarly-aligned conservatives.</p>
<blockquote>Rick Santorum's public grief, his savage heartbreak over the loss of a child, his exalted loyalty to the remaining disabled child, is exactly the source of his legitimacy over other men who merely oppose abortion. He willingly, exquisitely performs publicly the grief and outrage that the anti-choice women feel.</blockquote>
<p>In the adoption of this role of public grief over a birth loss, Santorum is assuming a role usually held by anti-choice women, who, Ferguson claims, are often motivated by stories of personal child-related loss. Ferguson notes that “Santorum is the rightful heir of Sarah Palin, whose folksy appeal to right wing women is largely based on the compassion calculus embodied by the quiet Downs Syndrome baby in her arms and the strapping son in military uniform by her side.” This calculus captures an entirely idealized notion of the life-death relationship: Trig, the baby not aborted (as so many Downs fetuses are) represents the refusal to terminate life based on a judgment of disability, while Track’s military service represents the corresponding willingness to sacrifice the able-bodied (no better represented than by young men in uniform) for the ideals of American liberty and freedom.</p>

<p>Ferguson calls this aspect of the conservative cause “violent compassion,” although perhaps ‘militant’ is just as descriptive. Life in this day and age is not something merely natural, it is something that must be willed, valued, and fought for (in hospitals and in legislatures). The role of the medical establishment here cannot be overlooked: the Santorums’s daughter Bella’s survival well beyond the life expectancy of children with Trisomy 18, a disorder much more severe than Downs Syndrome (Trisomy 21), is a testament not merely to the adamance of her parents, but also to an apparently limitless access to high-level medical care.</p>

<p>If every fight needs an enemy, it is easy to cast the medical establishment in this light. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq5no8mHtm0" target="_blank">To hear Santorum tell the story</a> of how the doctor, upon releasing the newborn Bella from the hospital, encouraged the couple to go home without oxygen, saying that they “needed to learn to let go,” it is easy to see the Santorums as courageously battling for Bella’s life with a doctor who is almost callously resigned to her death. Indeed, it is not impossible to see how the Santorums (and others) have extrapolated this heroic view of a personal life/death struggle into the larger cultural realm – a realm in which the medical establishment allows (or in cases of genetic ‘abnormalities,’ encourages) women to abort pregnancies – and have come to the conclusion that they are at fundamental odds with this culture.</p>

<p>In yet another poetic coincidence between the Santorums and the nation’s only Catholic first couple, the Kennedys themselves lost a baby during his time in office: in August 1963, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy was delivered by Caesarian section five and a half weeks early, but died after thirty-nine hours, despite being placed in a hyperbaric chamber to facilitate breathing. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/24/111024fa_fact_groopman" target="_blank">These days</a>, according to Dr. Camilia Martin, a senior neonatologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, the treatment of premature babies has advanced to the point where the survival rate of baby born at Patrick’s gestational age (thirty-two weeks) is nearly 100 percent.</p>

<p>Certainly the battle metaphor for saving young lives was already there in the 1960s; <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70D15FC3F55127B93C2A81783D85F478685F9" target="_blank">the Times, reporting on the grieving First Family</a>, noted that “the battle for the Kennedy baby was lost only because medical science has not yet advanced far enough to accomplish as quickly as necessary what the body can do by itself in its own time.” Medicine can now accomplish amazing things for such babies, but in so accomplishing them, our common understanding of infant death has shifted from that of a devastating yet natural event to an outrageous, unnatural exception. Under this paradigm, the life-endowing abilities of the body are reduced to their essentialist, miraculous components, and amid the rush to grant personhood status to a fertilized egg, we lose the more nuanced understanding of life that used to acknowledge the normal hazards of material, biological development, including miscarriage and infant death. (In addition to Patrick, the Kennedys also had a stillborn daughter.)</p>

<p>While it is of course wonderful that medicine is able to save and ameliorate the lives of more babies than ever before, it seems to have also produced an unfortunate cultural side effect of redefining death as the perversion of life – the result of some sort of lack, be it of technology or of willingness – rather than a natural part of it. Once death is viewed this way, it is all to easy to take sides ‘for’ and ‘against’ it, a thought that one could consider absurd were it not happening before our very eyes: Sarah Palin’s infamous ‘death panels’ are a now classic example of how the ‘socialist,’ ‘elite’ government is defined on the side of death. The ‘battle’ for life is now by necessity political.</p>

<p>From the standpoint that views death as an enemy, all claims about ‘quality of life’ become mere euphemisms for elitism. Only secular elites, people concerned with the ends not the means, the cost not the value, the success not the spirit of the attempt, dare to evaluate the meaning or validity of a life based on its ‘quality’. It is this paradigm that unifies Santorum’s views on birth control and abortion and his strongly negative feelings about higher education, as any emphasis on achievement conflicts with his commitment to love his daughter Bella – who will never attend kindergarden, let alone college – just as much as his other children. What seems like a mystifying, illogical leap to many is consistent with this grief-logic that compels Santorum to reaffirm at every turn his willingness to fight for not only Bella’s life, but also every child like her or potentially like her. That birth-loss – despite the fact that the Santorums have already faced it, and will face it again, inevitably, with Bella – is so unacceptable that it becomes the dominant value of their lives, the dominant metaphor of Santorum’s religion, and the dominant message of Santorum’s politics.</p>
<h3>Thinking (and) the body</h3>
<p>Most disabilities, however, are not faced in such stark philosophical circumstances – they are an aspect of life, but not its dominant component from birth. Indeed, one of the most powerful aspects to the concept of disability (as formulated by the field of Disability Studies) is its permeability. As Lennard J. Davis writes in “Crips Strike Back,” “anyone can become disabled, and in fact, most people will develop impairments with age… Indeed, the acronym TAB (Temporarily Able-Bodied) serves to remind us of the shaky footing on which normalcy rests” (<em>Bending over Backwards</em> 36).</p>

<p>While disability has been and remains the source of much discrimination and segregation, it also has the capacity to evoke a compassion that breaks down barriers between people, particularly those founded on education and intellect. This sort of compassion, which we might call empathetic compassion, is unlike the former kind that seems to congeal into a political crusade. Rather, this compassion has the opposite effect: unable to make any personal distinctions at all surrounding the notions of disability, it reduces everything to the solidarity of struggle against adverse circumstances.</p>

<p>It was this empathetic compassion on display when Tom Gjelten (sitting in for Diane Rehm) <a href="http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-02-27/timothy-snyder-thinking-twentieth-century-tony-judt/transcript" target="_blank">interviewed Timothy Synder</a>, who collaborated with his friend and fellow historian Tony Judt (who was diagnosed in 2008 with ALS) on what would be Judt’s final book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Twentieth-Century-Tony-Judt/dp/1594203237" target="_blank">Thinking the Twentieth Century</a></em>. The book, an intellectual review of that century’s major political movements and philosophies, took shape from a series of conversations held and recorded between Synder and Judt, a format that Synder proposed in light of the fact that Judt had lost control of his hands and arms and thus could no longer write in the traditional way.</p>

<p>The book is not about his illness, although Judt did write movingly about his condition in <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jan/14/night/?pagination=false" target="_blank">the New York Review of Books</a>. But as this caller demonstrates, many people confuse or conflate Tony’s intellectual work product with the unusual conditions in which the book was written.</p>
<blockquote><em><span style="line-height: 20px;">(</span><a style="color: #ff4b33; line-height: 20px;" href="http://thedianerehmshow.org/audio-player?nid=15657" target="_blank">42:45</a><span style="line-height: 20px;">) </span><strong>RENEE.</strong> </em>This is a brilliant discussion and I want to thank you, Timothy, for coming on the show today. I'm taking notes. I'm almost in tears at some points. You're speaking to my heart because of the way you're describing Tony, himself, about accepting his limitations and working within those. [...] But this mind, I can't wait to read the book. I'm a reading teacher, reading skills at a community college here. [...] I want to bring this to my students' attention. But what I wanted to ask, you covered some of it beautifully already, about the emotional part of what he had to deal with, especially that part of the book when you read about his -- going to head. But I wonder, Timothy, how did your collaboration begin? Did he ever speak to you personally on this level about his disease on a purely emotionally level?

<em><strong>GJELTEN.</strong></em> Well, you said, Timothy, that the book is very much intellectual, that there's nothing, really, in there about his struggle with the disease.</blockquote>
<p>Although mistaking this book for Tony’s other writings about his terminal condition is perhaps an understandable confusion, the awkwardness of that confusion is consequential, as it lends a rather uncomfortable aspect to Renee’s moving response. She is looking to share Tony’s book with her class, but it is unclear whether it is Tony the intellectual she wants to share or Tony the sufferer of ALS. Gjelten is quick to intervene to set the record straight, of course, but this clarification has the awkwardness of disappointment, as if the intellectual content of the book will not carry the emotion that so moved Renee. One knows for sure that was not the content of the book alone that moved her to call the show.</p>
<h3>Dismoderism</h3>
<p>In the first essay in his book, <em>Bending Over Backwards: Disability, Dismodernism and Other Difficult Positions</em>, Lennard J. Davis proposes what he calls dismoderism as the intellectual movement following postmodernism, formulating it as a corrective to the various movements of so-called identity politics.</p>
<blockquote>For all the hype of postmodern and deconstructive theory, these intellectual attempts made little or no impression on identity politics. Rather, those who pushed identity politics had very strong Enlightenment notions of the universal and the individual. The universal subject of postmodernism may be pierced and narrative-resistant but that subject was still whole, independent, unified, self-making, and capable. The dismodern era ushers in the concept that difference is what all of us have in common. That identity is not fixed but malleable. That technology is not separate but part of the body. That dependence, not individual independence, is the rule. There is no single clockmaker who made the uniform clock of the human body. The watchword of dismodernism could be: Form follows dysfunction. <em>(26-27)</em></blockquote>
<p>Although the secular, academic perspective of Davis could not be more different from that of Rick Santorum, it is the latter’s notion of being “disabled” in God’s eyes that is necessary, I believe, to complete the picture of dismodernism. Indeed, from this perspective, it is almost shocking to realize how important a medicalized understanding of the body has become in so-called “religious” contexts. Not terribly long ago, that word could be taken for granted as pertaining not primarily to the body, but to something far beyond it – and thus far more important. Not anymore, it would seem.</p>

<p>Thus to accuse Santorum of <em>religious</em> extremism when he expresses his disgust at the idea of leaving his faith at the door of the Oval Office is not quite fair. Yes, it is clear that he puts his Catholic faith (as he understands it) at the center of his life, and yes, he has no concept of a line between the political realm of guns and butter and the afterhours world of golf – er, NASCAR? – and babies. But this isn’t a case of religion versus secularism, of reactionary conservatives against far-sighted liberals; though it may seem so, this isn’t a throwback to the discussions of an earlier time. This is something different all together, as new to religion as it is to secular intellectual thought.</p>

<p>The body is everywhere. Welcome to the dismodern age.</p>
