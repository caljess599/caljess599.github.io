<h3>&amp; Wife</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am serials monogamist -- that is, I fall in love with men on TV, one after the other. My latest crush is incredibly retro but also uncannily timed: Rock Hudson, or rather, Stewart "Mac" McMillan as played by Hudson in the TV series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan_%26_Wife" target="_blank">"McMillan &amp; Wife"</a>. McMillan, the 40-ish police commissioner of San Francisco, is assisted in his crime-solving career by his indefatigable wife, the lovely 20-something Sally (Susan Saint James).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The May-July relationship on display here between the over-accomplished Mac and the woman who finally turned him from unapologetic heartbreaker to devoted husband is so charming as to rise to the level of myth, namely The Myth of Miraculous Heterosexuality. Mac and Sally cannot keep their hands or their innuendoes off of one another -- they want one another, frequently and unapologetically. Despite the visual chastity of 70s television (compared to today), the McMillan's marital chemistry is continuously on display and constitutes the show's fulcrum.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I explain what I mean by the MoMH, you need to understand that I have a more general theory about mystery shows, which is that shows about murder are really shows about family values. You wouldn't know it now, what with today's crime shows obsessed with psychopaths, gruesome graphics, and fanciful only-on-TV technology, if not all three, but once upon a time people on TV murdered people they knew for the classic, banal reasons people have always murdered: anger, jealousy, greed. Murder was personal, not technological, and the people who solved these crimes were set apart not by their knowledge of bugs or ballistics but by their moral rectitude, by which I mean our total confidence that they would never be swayed by those base motives to commit such crimes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One part of this moral exemplarity is their firm grounding in heteronormativity. Take Jessica Fletcher, heroine of "Murder, She Wrote"; she is a widowed school teacher whose sexual/romantic life is for all intents and purposes behind her. Indeed, in a way, the entire series hinges in a way on her remaining chaste, for in the show's pilot, her would-be suitor turns out to be the murderer! With Jessica confirmed as the sexless schoolmarm,  the show can procede to take her safely into the messy marriages and busted businesses that motivate each week's murder. Somewhat similarly, the incorruptibility of Lieutenant Columbo is guaranteed by his family-man status. However, in the case of this unique show, where we know from the beginning the identity of the culprit, the contrast between the murderous and the moral is reinforced by the invisibility of Mrs. Columbo, who is often discussed by never appears in the series.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Myth of Miraculous Heterosexuality as propagated in "Macmillan &amp; Wife" is another element of this television-murder-morality connection. In this case, though, visibility is key: Mac and Sally have this beautiful relationship that is meant to represent The Normative, and it is this norm that is threatened by crime. Indeed, it is shocking how many episodes revolve around Sally's endangerment, including the nearly tragic "The Fine Art of Staying Alive" (season 2, episode 6) in which she is kidnapped and held for the ransom of a famous painting. Mac, despondent and almost hapless, is prompted to recall the day he proposed to Sally as he contemplates the horror of her possible murder.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This episode makes clear that greed -- which I daresay remains a far more popular off-screen motive for murder than psychopathy! --  threatens the life of personal bliss and public service that Mac and Sally represent. This is the where we get to the heart of the MoMH: "Macmillan &amp; Wife" sells us the convenient truth that the relationship between two people (in this case, man and wife) functions as a guarantor of safety, a linchpin of social order against the threat of disorder.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Rock of Ages</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, this is just TV; while the small screen is unparalleled in its responsiveness to cultural trends, today's anything-goes climate belies the medium's historical conservative tendencies. In the case of "McMillan and Wife," we have the incredible irony that the paragon of heterosexual marriage is embodied by Rock Hudson, a gay man who became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Hudson#AIDS_and_death" target="_blank">the first celebrity to die of AIDS</a> (an event that did much to increase the visibility of the disease and the humanity of its victims). While TV has now made <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/the-new-mainstream-28-of-tv-watching-spent-on-lgbt-inclusive-shows/" target="_blank">not just peace but prosperity</a> with LGBT characters, people keep turning out on election day to vote against gay rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, as the recent passage in North Carolina of a constitutional amendment banning not just gay marriage but also civil unions sadly illustrates, a certain number of people are convinced by the Myth of Miraculous Heterosexuality's notion that society at large rises or falls by the state's enshrinement of contractual, monogamous, <em>heterosexual</em> relationships. While strictly speaking, legalizing gay marriage has nothing to do with the legality of gay sex, I find it hard to understand the resistance to gay marriage as being motivated purely by a reluctance to extend what amounts to a convenient legal contract (which is what marriage is, from the state perspective) to people of the same gender. I therefore suspect that it indeed has to do with sex; on this level, the state's recognition of contractual, monogamous, <em>homosexual</em> relationships constitutes a declaration that there exists no appreciable difference, <em>as far as the state is concerned</em>, between sex between a man and a woman and that between two women or two men. And if one understands the state as representative of <em>society,</em> the situation becomes uncomfortable for those who want to rely on society to reinforce what they are teaching their children, namely that heterosexuality is okay but homosexuality less so.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this sense, the resistance to gay marriage has much less to do with homosexism or homophobia than it does with a much more basic human dread, namely, that of being the last person caught holding an outdated opinion. While of course there will always be people who thrive on prejudice and bigotry, most people are very susceptible to the herd mentality (for better or for worse) and are more than prepared to go along (sooner or later) with the mainstream. This is the process through which societies and their mores and practices evolve over time, and while with the benefit of hindsight it looks natural, even inevitable, on an individual level, it can be quite painful for people to be prompted out of their comfort zones. This need for comfort is one reason why people teach their children to think according to their own prejudices, so they can have another voice reaffirming their own mindset.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you've grown up hearing and then thinking that gay people are different, and gay relationships aren't like straight relationships, well, it's not going to feel good when you start hearing that to think that way means you are a bigot. And that charge makes people feel ashamed of what they have felt and (perhaps) have done. But instead of changing their minds (which requires facing the shame), many people defend themselves from that shame by digging in: they resolve that what they were told all along was right, and that therefore the charge of bigotry is heinously false. Or, in a variation on that theme, they whitewash the acting out of their prejudices. <a href="http://therumpus.net/2012/05/the-week-in-greed-6-to-behave-like-the-fallen-world/" target="_blank">Steve Almond's analysis of Romney's homophobic history</a> describes both its motivation by a quest for popularity as well as the candidate's inability or refusal to feel remorse for his youthful misdeeds, because it is somehow more palatable to claim to have no memory of the event rather than to own up to have not only been homophobic (as many young boys were and are) but also physically cruel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While I don't mean to be breaking out the tiny violins for those against marriage equality in lieu of popping the champagne to celebrate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/us/politics/obama-says-same-sex-marriage-should-be-legal.html" target="_blank">Obama's historic announcement in its favor</a>, I think it is important to point out that the reason that people in my generation (and younger) don't "get" the problem people have with gay marriage is not just a question of our broader perspective. While certainly part of the changing attitudes toward homosexuality has to do with greater exposure to and greater comfort with gays and lesbians (the whole "family, friends, and neighbors" argument cited by Obama), prejudice can thrive even in the most intimate of circumstances -- just look at the institution of slavery.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not being prejudiced is partly about never learning to be so, but also never having an incentive to learn. If it is socially acceptable to be racist or homophobic -- as it was not terribly long ago -- many people will adopt those attitudes in order to reassure themselves that they, too, are socially acceptable, i.e., that they are the way the majority of people agree is the right way to be. The need to feel accepted is so strong that once the association between practice (in this case, disdaining or excluding others) and payoff (in this case, social acceptance) is formed, the practice sticks, having been internalized as principle, even when the payoff diminishes or disappears.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Legal, tender</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The person who should be most keenly aware of this diminishing payoff is none other than Mitt Romney, who has been essentially forced to declare his opposition to gay marriage and civil unions in order to draw yet another line in the sand between the two major parties. For someone <a href="http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/quiet-rooms-like-the-quiet-car-on-the-acela/" target="_blank">who prefers a quiet room for discussions of income inequality</a>, you can only imagine the internal wincing Romney suffers when he must address such the issue he calls "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/us/politics/romney-reaffirms-opposition-to-marriage-or-similar-for-gay-couples.html" target="_blank">a very tender and sensitive topic</a>". While in his previous incarnation as a Massachusetts moderate, Romney once boasted to that state's Log Cabin Republicans that he was more supportive of gay rights than Senator Edward M. Kennedy, now he is explicitly against granting gay couples equal marriage rights. Romney goes so far as to state that the issue isn't one of semantics, i.e., the use of the term marriage; he's against the granting of rights equivalent to marriage for same-sex couples under any name (civil union, domestic partnership), and he supports a constitutional amendment to this effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even if we assume that Romney is indeed sincerely, personally opposed to marriage equality, he's already demonstrated an ability to remake himself for the needs of his constituency. He should therefore be intelligent enough to understand that there is exceedingly little political capital to be gained from standing on the opposite side of history, even if that is what his constituency demands. Romney's situation is the political equivalent of Chic-fil-A's policy of remaining closed (out of religious conviction) on Sunday: no matter how diminished the returns become on that policy, they can't change it without looking like hypocrites. There is simply no where to go but the status quo.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the note that the Obama campaign's new "Forward" slogan seeks to hit -- and Romney of all people has to understand, that in politics as in business, if you aren't moving ahead, you are falling behind. Yet the party Romney has gone to contortionist lengths to woo is all about looking backwards, in both economic and social policy. Romney's confidence that he can somehow stop the course of history and reinstate the military policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell is as misguided as his insistance that <span style="line-height: 20px;">his straight-from-the-80s pro-military, anti-tax agenda is the ticket to revitalizing this country. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The idea that the country would bother to modify the constitution to deny equal recognition and appropriate legal conveniences to same-sex couples  is but the icing on this stale, backwards cake.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let's pop that champagne.</p>
