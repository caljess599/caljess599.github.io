        <p>I’ve felt sick since November 8th, but sickest of all this week, hoping (in vain) for some sort of <em>deus ex machina</em> to prevent the final conjoining of the words “President of the US” and “Donald Trump”. And yet, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/divided-states-of-america">it has been a long time coming</a>. The whole time “we” were feeling astounded, wonderful, or just merely content that Obama was President, Trumpism was brewing.</p>

<p>As terrified as I am, I have come to several conclusions about the outcome of this election that give me some measure of consolation:</p>

<p><em>Trump being elected doesn’t define America.</em> Yes, this election will have consequences, possibly terrible ones, but Trump’s election hasn’t changed who we are as individuals. We remain the same people we were before November 8th, and so we are as free as we were then to think and act. We do not have to ever consider Trump a legitimate, qualified, or decent holder of the Office of the President. I know I never will.</p>

<p><em>There is a strategic silver lining in Hillary Clinton’s defeat.</em> If Hillary Rodham were being inaugurated tomorrow morning, I’d be taking the day off in celebration. And I’m sad about that. I’m sad for her, I’m sad for women, and I’m sad for our country. But her tenure would have surely been marked by the same level (or worse) of obstructionism from the Republicans and rage from those people who flocked to Trump rallies. As it stands now, the right gets a chance to satisfy the demands of its base. The reaction to their attempt has a far better chance of transforming the GOP than four or eight more years of a Democratic President. After all, it didn't work during eight years of Obama.</p>

<p><em>Our fear should motivate us to get involved in local government.</em> The striking thing (to me, anyway) is that the parties of both constituencies appear to believe that the solution to all America’s problems reside in national laws and policies. <em>If only we could get the right people in power</em>, the thinking goes, <em>everything can be fixed!</em> The passive voice in that last phrase is purposeful: what we are hoping for is not just salvational change, but the permission to check out until the next election. Democrats now have a lot of very powerful reasons not to do that. And I am convinced that local action is the key to all political renewal. Voting is wonderful, <em>but it is not enough</em>.</p>
