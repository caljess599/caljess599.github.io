        <p>The body has a way of dealing with food-borne illness: ejecting the contaminant via all possible means. This process can be unpleasant, even horrid. But it works.</p>

<p>The mind, perhaps, works differently. It can be much more difficult to recognize the symptoms of a ‘mental food’ illness than a physical one. We dine on media much the way we dine on food—mostly driven by habit. And habits are hard to break.</p>

<p>But they can be broken. Often what happens is that we hit some sort of bottom, which in turn provokes a crisis—literally, a turning point. A few weeks ago, I experienced precisely this. I realized that with every piece of news I consumed, I only felt more enraged and more powerless. And I also realized that I was choosing this experience; no one was putting a gun to my head and telling me ‘read/listen to/watch this news or else’.</p>

<p>So I decided to stop. And as with the stomach flu or a severe hangover, I felt better—much better—within 48 hours. So good, in fact, that I decided to keep on rationing my news consumption. Here’s what I've learned.</p>

<p><em>Silence is the perfect antidote to powerlessness.</em> Silence is a reclaiming of one’s own mental space. It says to all the forces that would impinge on it: “no, you cannot have it, it is mine.” It is in silence that we can truly decide, rather than have whatever voices are around us at that moment decide for us. And making conscious decisions—even if they are small as what to turn on or do for the next hour—is the key to feeling powerful as opposed to overwhelmed.</p>

<p><em>Attention is too valuable a resource to squander absent-mindedly.</em> There is too much media to consume, period. You will never consume it all. So stop trying. Instead, focus on how what you do consume makes you feel. Several months ago, I began to notice that much of the reading I did of the news online did not actually add anything to my life: it did not broaden my knowledge, or change my perspective, or even brighten my day. Mostly, it did just the opposite. I began to ask myself: why am I bothering? Now I take the time I used to spend mindlessly reading the daily newspaper and spend it reading longer-form pieces that <em>do</em> broaden my knowledge, change my perspective, and sometimes even brighten my day. In fact, the less time I spend consuming media that does not have that effect, the more enjoyable the other stuff becomes.</p>

<p><em>All affirmative action starts with genuine awareness.</em> Attention is limited, and must be rationed, but awareness can be nearly infinitely deepened. You can be very aware, and very well informed, without paying constant attention. You can put your phone down and still be a functioning, respected member of society. But this is a conclusion we will have to reach <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/opinion/sunday/resist-the-internet.html">in spite of our digital devices</a>. The companies that design apps and media companies that depend on advertising for revenue will never tell us so; their business model relies on the falsehood that more is always better—simply because <em>more is better for them.</em> </p>

<p><em>Consumption is not the enemy; unconscious consumption is.</em> It has been said that the reason dieting is so difficult is that, unlike, say, alcohol, you cannot just altogether quit eating. The same can be said for media consumption. Indeed, I am never going to stop reading, nor am I going to forswear the occasional, glorious binge watch. And just like with food, we are always going to be in an environment full of media, an awful lot of it put there by someone else with the goal of making a buck off you. This should make you skeptical, but more than that, it should make you realize how much power you have in your choice. Become a media 'gourmet' by seeking higher-quality fare and by pushing away your plate when you have had had your daily (or weekly) fill. Support newspapers and magazines whose journalism you value by subscribing, after which you can feel free to only consume as much as fits within your media diet. You can leave articles 'on your plate' so to speak.</p>

<p><em>We are not the media. We get to turn our backs!</em> Ever since L’Innominato’s press conference last month, I have had this wonderful fantasy that, at some point, all journalists and reporters would just declare “a day without T—.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/opinion/an-issue-without-trump.html">As the New York Times did</a>.) No reporting, no analysis, not even a mention of a single tweet. If he held a press conference, the press corps would stand there and simply turn their backs. But this is a fantasy precisely because the media is employed to engage no matter what. Quite literally, their livelihoods depend on it. Instead of waiting for them to turn their backs, we can simply turn off the tv/radio/app. We have a right—and a duty to ourselves—to honor the feeling that enough is enough.</p>
