        <p>Politics today, on both the right and the left, has become a politics of grievance. There is nothing wrong with believing that there is something wrong—in our cities, in our country, in this world. But a politics of grievance is dangerous because grievance is fueled by certainty. The phrase “list of grievances” captures this idea exactly; what is wrong, who is wrong—both can be specified, enumerated. To borrow a mathematical concept, the world of grievance is the world of natural numbers.</p>

<p>Grief is different, the way infinity is different from natural numbers. Grief cannot be enumerated; it leads us to reflect, to question, to suffer—all emotions that open us to the world and to our lack of complete understanding of the world. If grievance is a what, then grief is a why. Grievance is knowing, while grief is a feeling within a place of acknowledged non-knowledge.</p>

<p>I have struggled to gather my thoughts about the recent events in my adopted home city. I felt, and still feel, horror about the displays of white supremacist feeling that took place so close to where I live and work. But almost more than horror, I felt incredulous: how is it possible that, in 2017, killing Jews can be posited as a credible political goal? It feels so passé, so ignorant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/19/opinion/watching-charlottesville-from-jerusalem.html">as to be laughable</a>.</p>

<p>Yet as we know, in Charlottesville, the violence of one man pushed grievance into grief; driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, he killed Heather Heyer and injured a score of others. Visiting the scene of that crime, the side street on our pedestrian mall that, for now, serves as a public memorial to Ms. Heyer, the sense of grief is palpable. We grieve not just for her lost life, but for the violation of the norms of a free society her death represents; in our country, one is free to say what one loves, hates, thinks, and feels, but no one is free to kill. But this man did kill, and such is the conundrum of personal liberty. We can condemn hate, we can call it pathetic and passé, but we will always be vulnerable to terrorism. Indeed, this vulnerability is the price and pre-condition of liberty.</p>

<p>Apparently, the last post that Ms. Heyer put on Facebook was a reissue of the old call-to-action phrase “If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention.” This quote has now dually made the rounds of the Internet with her name and imaged attached. (I wonder when the word ‘outraged’ replaced ‘angry’, which is the way I remember the quote, back when it was a bumper sticker and not a viral meme.) Frankly, though, as I observed in an essay I wrote last year, the main problem of our times is no longer apathy or complacency—the problem is that everyone is angry, all the time.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe me, consider the behavior of the local citizens at the <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/three-arrested-as-councilors-vote-to-shroud-confederate-statues-at/article_5a42f7a8-86d0-11e7-87a5-23ba81576181.html">most recent City Council meeting</a>, where three people were arrested and the police had to escort the 5-member Council out of the room for their safety. These citizens fancy themselves the complete opposite of the alt-right, and to the extent that they voice a rejection of white nationalism, racism and anti-Semitism, they are. Yes, they represent love, not hate, plurality, not prejudice. But they are similarly aggrieved—and similarly sure about their worldview. No, they don’t blame blacks or Jews or immigrants for the social ills and injustices they see around them (to which they now add the death of Ms. Heyer); good leftists that they are, they lay all that at the feet of City Council.</p>

<p>I think this is laughable, but apparently in this version of liberalism, outrage is the only true badge of membership. But this is where, for me, grief is perverted back into a tired politics of grievance. It has become increasingly clear to me that outrage has become the main currency of political discourse in this country. But because outrage is cheap and abundant, it is as useless as paper scrip—it cannot buy you anything of real value, no matter how much of it you collect.</p>

<p>Outrage claims a moral high ground, but it contains no actual information; never was this more clear to me than when, having left town the Saturday of the alt-right protest, and having heard from a friend about the vehicular attack, I looked at Twitter in the hopes of finding news about what was happening in Charlottesville. But what I found was an endless spewing of shallow, repetitive reactions registering and demanding outrage. On social media, <em>if you aren’t outraged, you don’t exist</em>.</p>

<p>And yet, that is where the world is headed. I find myself shaking my head in agreement with <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/28/who-owns-the-internet">this zinger from Elizabeth Kolbert</a>: “People who worry about the fate of democracy still write (and read) books. Those who are determining it prefer to tweet.”</p>

<p>I suppose this means the world will leave me behind; I feel put off by identity politics and less and less inclined to call myself a liberal. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/opinion/trump-moderates-bipartisanship-truth.html">Moderation attracts me</a>, as I’m no longer comfortable with any party or group who claims to know everything or have all the answers. I simply do not trust a person—not even myself—who believes everything she thinks.</p>
