<p>The 7-day separation between the Christmas holiday and the turn of the new calendar year marks an interesting tension between two competing human urges: the pull of the familiar and the urge to change. Even for people for whom Christmas has no religious significance, this holiday usually translates into at least some sort of break in their normal rhythm, whether it be time off of work or increased traffic at the mall. Many non-Christian or secular people “celebrate the season” by getting together with friends or visiting family members. Americans, â€¨famous for their unrooted lifestyles, pay homage to less peripatetic times gone by by trekking home for the holidays. Especially for nuclear families with young children, the holidays are a common site around which family traditions are constructed and fortified, year by year.
But then there comes, sure as returns of unwanted gifts, the Possibility of a New Year.</p>

<p>Here we display our undaunted American optimism and belief in self-determination. This credence in the possibility of transformation marked the foundation of the United States, and lives on–albeit in a less civic-minded form–as the basis of an economy driven by products that offer the possibilities of a better you: richer, thinner, happier.</p>

<p>Ah, but no matter how our waistlines and wallets fare this year, we can count on family and friends to welcome us in from the cold of a winter’s night.</p>
