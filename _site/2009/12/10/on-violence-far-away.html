Violent events of all sorts, from domestic tragedies to school rampages to workers – or soldiers – going postal are always breaking news. The deaths of American servicemen and women killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are honored by photos and silence on the NewsHour. The passing of notable people, some famous, some you’ve never heard of, are marked by obituaries.
