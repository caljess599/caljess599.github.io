<p>This is, supposedly, the season of giving. In economic terms, this translates into an annual ritual in which we buy things as a sign of our love and friendship for those around us.</p>

<p>Is it so odd of a question to ask why we do this? Do we need these gifts to feel appreciated? And do we enjoy shopping for things to give other people, with all the worry about how much money we spend and if these gifts will be enjoyed?</p>

<p>Certainly, our economy of the last half century has depended more and more on the economic stimulus of mass consumption, and it is no joke to think that most retailers depend on holiday spending to remain in business.</p>

<p>But this is the greatest irony of all: in the same span of time that we have built an economy out of spending on the unnecessary, we are unable to give ourselves—and the country as a whole—things all of us need: universal health care comes to mind first, these days, but a successful public education system and a justice system that does more than stuff ever-increasing numbers of people, in particular black men, into prisons are also worth mentioning.</p>

<p>And yet the public discourse on measures to insure or educate or not incarcerate inevitably boils down to “we can’t afford it.” No one wants to pay higher taxes for these essential services.</p>

<p>They’d rather spend their money on Christmas shopping.</p>
