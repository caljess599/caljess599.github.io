But we’ll take our chances<br />

<h3 id="common-ground">Common ground</h3>
<p>I have a definite memory of seeing the painting pictured above, Jean-Francois Millet’s <em>Des glaneuses</em> (<em>The Gleaners</em>), in the Musée d’Orsay in Paris as an adolescent, but I’m pretty certain that I did not know at the time what a gleaner was, and did not take that opportunity to find out. Or if I did, the knowledge didn’t remain.</p>

<p>Gleaning is the agricultural practice of collecting leftover crops after a field has been harvested. In the Torah, God commanded that every farmer leave a portion of his crop purposefully not harvested and to leave the gleaning to others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your land or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the alien. I am the Lord your God. <em>(Lev. 19:9-10)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Book of Deuteronomy reiterates and elaborates on this obligation, further specifing that this is commanded because of the Israelites’ past as slaves in Egypt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the alien, the fatherless and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow. When you harvest the grades in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this. <em>(Deut. 24:19-22)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly this practice is a form of charity, or welfare, but it is a very specific kind thereof. It is not a direct handout, but rather an opportunity to reap sustenance through the labor of harvesting. In this way, it affirms the notion that the land and its fruits are in some respect still common to all. While communal farming is starting to make a comeback, particularly in the form of the urban or school garden, these activities are irrelevant to gleaning; not only are they small-scale, but they are designed as a supplement to other food sources, being relied upon merely to promote the availability of fresh and ultra-local produce to the community or school.</p>

<p>Gleaning, on the other hand, occurs at the margins of widespread cultivation, relying not only on freedom of access but also on the purposeful creation of excess like that commanded in the Torah. By the phrase “creation of excess” I mean the designation of a share of the crops as irrelevant to one’s own interests—economic or otherwise. It is simply left alone, in the fields. In this sense it is in fact the opposite of a surplus, which is harvested and counted and considered, often to the detriment of the economic viability of farming, given the negative effect of oversupply on prices.</p>

<p>The social implications of the differences between gleaning and modern food welfare (food stamps, food pantries, soup kitchens) are telling. Indeed, it would be a mistake to think of them as equivalents at all. Besides the obvious differences in procedure, there is also the fact that gleaning is intended (at least in the Bible) to help not merely the poor, but specifically those who lack community ties (as may aliens, children without fathers, and widows) that would admit them access to more direct forms of assistance. In this sense, gleaning is not commanded so that the members of the community might eat (a human right) but as an extra-communal right, so that <em>anyone</em> might live off the land (an alien right). Gleaning is not taking care of the community, but rather of people who, for one reason or another, may have fallen through its initial safety nets.</p>

<p>Purposefully here, I am tweaking the traditional understanding of “human rights” as the broadest possible extension of freedoms—both “freedoms to” (e.g., speak, practice a religion), and “freedoms from” (e.g., hunger, destitution). Possibly, we have not done ourselves any favors by using the category of our species as the largest and most legitimate criteria for the application of the Golden Rule. Certainly, the notion (and even the formal declaration of) universal human rights hasn’t done much to end the widespread and multiform miseries of poverty, war, violence, exploitation and repression on this planet.</p>

<p>We are good, on the whole, at caring well for those with whom we have close ties or allegiances (friends, family, maybe neighbors, or fellow members of a religious group). The Christian ideal—the gospel brought by Christ—is the notion that we treat everyone as our brother in Christ. Given the emphasis on the “chosen” nature of the Jews, this is absolutely a revelation, but it does not mean that the Old Testament had no awareness of the need to extend sustenance to all. The Torah’s commandment to create excess is aimed precisely at this goal, and it does so without requiring any feeling (brotherly or otherwise) toward the potential gleaners, nor any action on their behalf. Indeed, it is a non-action, a leaving alone, and it is done not in relation to one’s fellows at all, but in relation to God.</p>

<p>Last week I had the opportunity to assist a local (to my home town, Oakland, CA) winery called <a href="http://www.ulcellars.com/">Urban Legend</a> in its semiannual bottling. Of course the grapes aren’t grown in town, but the wine is made and aged in Oakland’s warehouse district, just a few blocks from the train tracks that lead to Jack London Square. Making wine requires a fair amount of equipment and space, but getting it into bottles efficiently and safely is a process all of its own, and when it only occurs twice a year, it makes sense to outsource the bottling rather than purchasing the equipment oneself. Not only is this feat possible, you can even have the bottling facility come to you rather than vice versa: Urban Legend bottles its wine using <a href="http://ultimamobilebottling.com/">Ultima Mobile Bottling</a>, which shows up with a truck that contains a compact bottling plant.</p>

<p>Urban Legend supplies all the pieces that went into the process: the wine (which is run through hoses from the winery into the truck), the bottles, their boxes, the corks, the capsules (that’s the foil part), the labels, and the box labels. Friends and associates of the winery owners served as the labor. While the process is mechanized, it is not entirely automated: the bottles need to be unboxed, herded into the assembly line, with the boxes then placed above the packer’s heads; the capsules need to be dropped on the full, corked bottles; the bottles need to be boxed; and finally the boxes labeled and stacked on pallets. The filling of the bottles, the corking, the sealing of the foil onto the top, and the bottle labeling are all done automatically, but of course the whole process needed to be monitored, and was by the two young men from Ultima, who fed corks into to the cork bin and regularly checked the bottles for the correct pressure.</p>

<p>While I’m not stranger to the concept of industrial production, it is quite another thing to see it in progress. As a sight not commonly witnessed in person these days, especially in a truck, it proved marvelously fascinating. To work at the pace and rhythm of a process that has mechanism instead of mind made for a lot of giggling, I’m not sure why. Maybe it was the novelty not only of bottling wine, but of doing so on an Oakland street. During the first run I labeled boxes as they came down off the truck. (I put them on upside down, since the wine boxes would be stored with the corks down, being flipped over before placed on a pallet.) The second shift I got to do perhaps the most exciting part, which was to case the bottles as they came down the line. I was working with a woman who had a lot of experience, and so she taught me the most efficient practice, which was for us to actually fill the same box: she would get the box down from the rack, put six bottles in it, then pass it to me for six more, after which I would close the lid and push it into the automatic taper, after which it slid down a short ramp to be labeled and stacked. By the time I’d done my part, she’d started the next box, so there was very little idle time for either of us.</p>

<p>Someone usurped my position as a packer for the next shift, so I went to join my father, who was installed in his usual role of dropping the capsules onto the corked bottles. It was feasible in one, but it was easier and more social in two. But as the job that required the least full-body movement, it was the most painful. Before long, my back was killing me. Part of that was my unideal footwear, but most of it was due to the simple fact that the human body in general, and mine in particular, doesn’t take to that kind of standstill, repetitive labor. I can walk for miles happily outdoors, but even a brief trip through a museum—slow walking, standing—will give me a backache in short order.</p>

<p>My father and I left after the morning shift, roughly four hours of work. Rewarded with a nice lunch and two bottles of wine each, we returned to the car, tired and sore. Certainly it had been an entertaining morning, but the idea of working that way everyday, all day was a dreadful one. Not that sitting on a chair in front of a screen all day is necessarily any easier on the human body, but I’d managed that before, whereas I couldn’t see myself ever adjusting to life on a factory floor. But even more to the point, despite my fatigue and sore back, I felt that a few hours of factory-like labor had made for a charming volunteer experience, whereas I couldn’t see myself “volunteering” to pilot a desk for a half day. And I thought it was odd, on some level, that the basic premise of a commodity-filled (if no longer -based) economy, i.e., manufacturing, appeared to me as something exotic, a hidden world brought rarely into view, despite the complete dependence of my lifestyle upon it.</p>

<p>Gleaning, I learned recently, is making a comeback, albeit within the system of industrialized agriculture. As NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/133059889/gleaning-a-harvest-for-the-needy-by-fighting-waste">reported in January</a>, increasing effort is being made to reclaim food that would otherwise simply be wasted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Food gets left in the field for all kinds of reasons. Two big ones are that mechanical harvesting misses a lot—and sometimes the crops aren’t pretty enough for supermarket shelves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“The statistics are that 96 billion pounds of food are left—this is pre-consumer food—goes to waste in this country,” says Linda Tozer of the <a href="http://www.endhunger.org/">Society of St. Andrew</a> an organization that coordinates farmers around the Southeast and out West.</p>

<p>(St. Andrew is a rather mysterious saint, best known as the patron saint of Scotland—although see <a href="http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/articles/2001-andrew-women.htm">this fascinating piece on his connection to women’s rights</a> (all the more interesting given that Andrew means brave, manly. The society is perhaps named for Andrew because of the fact that it was he who brought to the attention of Jesus the boy whose loaves and fishes would be miraculously multiplied to feed the five thousand (John 6:1-14).)</p>

<p>While there is no doubt that the Society (and others) are delivering on the mission to feed the hungry from field leftovers, the circumstances that make gleaning possible are completely altered in the present context, as the owners of the fields are leaving food on the field not in fulfillment of a religious (or “humanitarian”) mandate, but of an economic one: the food is either simply missed by mechanical harvest methods (and thus too expensive to harvest manually) or it is not good enough to be sold. It is neither excess nor surplus, it is simply waste.</p>

<p>Also while I was in California this time, I heard the news that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/us/14bcfema.html">Bay Area food banks will take a significant funding hit</a>, losing $1.5 million in funding from the Emergency Food and Shelter National Board. San Francisco (which is a county and a city), along with Marin and Napa counties, will get none of the remaining $1.9 million allocation.</p>

<p>In this economic climate, this couldn’t be worse news. Sadder still is that, it seems, no one (or very few people, anyway) is in favor of people in the richest nation on earth going hungry or being food insecure. And yet here we are… our government, supposedly for the people and by the people, is making these choices.</p>

<p>I wonder, although perhaps naively, whether charity and the creation of excess were easier in an agrarian economy, whether it was simpler to understand and share abundance when most people worked on or in relation to the land. Have we created wealth, an invisible, magical, numerical concept, at the expense of the palpable, nourishing, uncountable notion of excess?</p>

<p>What can we leave in the fields for today’s gleaners, now that we have already left the land?</p>
