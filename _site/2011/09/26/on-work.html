<blockquote>One thing, however, is clear -- Nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities, and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labour-power. This relation has no natural basis, neither is its social basis one that is common to all historical periods.</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">--Karl Marx, <em>Capital</em> (vol. 1)</p>

<h3>Jobless</h3>
<p>I feel it is an act of courage to reveal that I am one of the millions of Americans currently unemployed. That courage perhaps implies a remnant shame, the shame of being unproductive, which is perhaps – second only to “unproductive” sex – the cardinal sin in an America still in many ways beholden to its Puritan and Protestant foundations.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that people who moved to the New World worked very hard; they had to, and even then, their survival was not guaranteed. That they did survive, and even thrive, fighting for the independence of a new nation, made sure that striving and effort became a fundamental part of our culture. Even now, the dream of immigrants is not to find gold on the streets (although I think we did go through that phase), but to work hard to earn the means to a better life.</p>

<p>As the weeks pass into months in this laboring hiatus, I have been reflecting a great deal on what it means to work, or to not work, and the true meaning of those terms. Like many terms, they take their meaning(s) from context. In general, working connotes the performance of activities for compensation, activities that most people would not engage in – or at least not under the same terms and conditions – were they not so compensated. Working is therefore an obligation, imposed upon us so that we can secure the money that we then exchange for the objects and services (commodities) we require to shelter, clothe, feed, transport, and amuse ourselves (and any dependents we may have).</p>

<p>Second only to the necessity of work is the expectation of loving and/or excelling at one’s work. This is how the necessity to work is naturalized, in that work becomes part of one’s individual character rather than an aspect of a system that, while dominant, is hardly, as Marx notes, “natural.” The person who offers his labor for sale, i.e., as a commodity, Marx notes, must be in a state of freedom: he must be <em>free to</em> alienate his labor from his person, meaning, he must not be a slave, who is owned outright, and thus cannot alienate his labor-power. While there is an obvious positive to being free in this sense, the other freedom Marx identifies is a bit more fraught: he must also be <em>free from</em> the ability to produce commodities himself, which he would then trade for (or sell in order to buy) items he needs but does not directly produce. In other words, he must be alienated from the means of production.</p>

<p>From this perspective, joblessness takes on a greater meaning, for it threatens one’s very survival and prosperity. Indeed, plenty of families and individuals have lost their homes, equity, and savings as a result of long-term unemployment and the corresponding loss of income. For many, even if they do find work again, these changes in lifestyle are likely permanent. While it may be crass to delineate a scale of misfortune, the fact that many upper-class families are permanently losing their financial status built over years of work strikes, at least in me, a particular chord of fear, pointing out the fundamental instability of any prosperity that depends on continuous wage-based employment.</p>
<h3>Excess</h3>
<blockquote>For instance, it may be that machines will take over most of the work that is of real, practical importance, but that human beings will be kept busy by being given relatively unimportant work. It has been suggested, for example, that a great development of the service industries might provide work for human beings. Thus people would spent their time shining each other's shoes, driving each other around in taxicabs, making handicrafts for one another, waiting on each other's tables, etc. This seems to us a thoroughly contemptible way for the human race to end up, and we doubt that many people would find fulfilling lives in such pointless busy-work.</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">--Theodore Kaczynski, "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm" target="_blank">Industrial Society and Its Future</a>"</p>
<p>I can remember thinking, as a child, quite unprompted, about garbage, and where it all went, and whether there was room for it all wherever it went. This was before the days of curbside recycling, green bins, and reusable shopping bags – although it was still the time when paper bags were the default, and I think we used them in the bin, rather than buying garbage bags, at least at that point.</p>

<p>I recall coming to the conclusion that if this potential problem had crossed my mind, it must have certainly crossed the minds of adults, of truly wise and responsible people, and that therefore I could feel reassured that the situation was being handled. Of course, as I grew up, I learned that this was not entirely true. Landfills were filling, and yet our population kept growing, our footprint kept expanding. And this was good, this growth, because growth was the lifeblood of our economy.</p>

<p>High school vignette 1: When the unabashedly Marxist history professor, beloved by all, taught the meaning of the term <em>reification</em>, the main example he used was the economy. I still think of that whenever I hear the economy discussed on the news, which is of course all the time.</p>

<p>High school vignette 2: One assembly, we watched a video presentation made by the group that called itself, at the time, Zero Population Growth (ZPG). (Since 2002, it has called itself <a href="http://www.populationconnection.org/site/PageServer" target="_blank">Population Connection</a>.) The video was a time-elapse representation of human population. As time progressed, dots representing a million people would appear on the map, indicating population growth. The only time a dot ever disappeared, the voiceover noted, was during the black plague. Poof.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*        *        *</p>
<p>We now know, it seems, that there is such thing as too much of a good thing. And we have too much of everything. Too many people, too many farm animals, too many cars, too much garbage, too much pollution. We also have the too muches of maldistribution – certain folks have too much money, while others have none; many people in the industrialized world eat too many calories, while famine persists (not to mention the conundrum of being overweight <em>and</em> food insecure, a daily reality for many in this country); and all of us living in the world of <em>mercatus triumphans</em> have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?ref=magazine" target="_blank">too many choices</a> among the things we consume, while others have little or none.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t dare suggest that scarcity is a comfortable or easy thing, but it does seem that our human history has better equipped us to deal with scarcity than with the non-abundant excess that is the hallmark of late capitalism. Humans live better in abundance, I think we can all agree on that, but we aren’t necessarily more satisfied with excess than we are with scarcity. This may sound absurd at first read, but I think if you pause and reflect for a moment, you will see my meaning. Excess simply isn’t a basic human need; indeed, it is because of their excess (in the form of cheap and ubiquitous processed foods) that fat, salt, and sugar have gone from a regular, moderated part of the human diet to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Overeating-Insatiable-American-Appetite/dp/B004NSVE32/" target="_blank">pariahs needing to be exiled</a>, lest we all perish from overconsumption. While I don’t question the scientific data that such foods are “chemically addictive,” it is most certainly the context and not the content of these substances that has changed. I haven’t done the research, but I feel pretty confident that 100 years ago no one was talking about bacon as a dangerous drug.</p>

<p>Certainly, we are designed to be incentivized to secure abundance: we work the land so we can eat, we make things so we can live more safely and more comfortably, we invent things so that we can longer and in better health. But when that work is done, we are incentivized (by our sore muscles and spent minds) to rest, recover, and restore our energies for the next necessary exertion. There is something perverse to me about the idea of sitting at a desk all day in order to have money to go to the grocery store in order to carefully avoid the majority of the products there that, if we succumb to their built-in temptations, will ruin our health. Abundance is great, excess not so much.</p>

<p>As Marx points out in his investigation of the mysterious substance called capital, and the socio-economic system that grew up around it, excess is key. Excess is where all the magic is (hear the irony), the magic that turns Money into More Money (M â†’ M’). And by the logic that no capitalist would inject his money into the market in order to come away with an equal amount of money, it follows that no capitalist would stop putting his money into the market when he can, in so doing, make more money with it.</p>

<p>Historically, the source of the majority of this excess was the surplus value “hidden” in labor-power. Increasingly, however, it is possible to make money out of money with very little human labor, or perhaps with a lot of labor by a very small percentage of the population. Automation has made our lives easier, and technology has made them longer, but only at the peril of making them unlivable – our labor is not needed, and we run out of money long before we run out of needs, troubles, or breath. Driverless cars are a great example of this industrial-world dilemma: <a href="http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2011/04/google-engineer-claims-its-driverless-cars-could-save-a-million-lives-every-year.html" target="_blank">relinquishing the wheel to machines would save an estimated million lives a year</a>, but it would also eliminate numerous jobs, therefore making it more difficult for people to ‘earn the living’ for the life preserved by a safer highway.</p>

<p>I’m certainly not trying to romanticize pre-industrial life. But I do think it is time that we question the notion of work, that we examine why, as Kathi Weeks notes in her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Problem-Work-Feminism-Imaginaries-ebook/dp/B005KGTQ0O/" target="_blank">The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics, and Postwork Imaginaries</a></em>, “the fact that at present one must work to ‘earn a living’ is taken as part of the natural order rather than as a social convention” (Kindle Location 46-7). “The mystery here,” she says in the opening lines of the book, “is not that we are required to work or that we are expected to devote so much time and energy to its pursuit, but rather that there is not more active resistance to this state of affairs.” (KL 18)</p>

<p>Certainly this reevaluation is not simply a matter of finding new, or reverting to old, ways of sustaining ourselves on the planet. It is matter of rethinking our social relations, for almost every institution and individual is defined, at least in part, around the notion of work. Weeks writes:</p>
<blockquote>After the family, waged work is often the most important, if not sole, source of sociality for millions. Raising children with attributes that will secure them forms of employment that can match if not surpass the class standing of their class standing of their parents is the gold standard of parenting. (KL 93-4)</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, as Weeks goes on to explain, preparing people for work is the goal of the educational, medical, and social welfare establishments, justifying (although increasing unjustifiably, these days) the prison system as well as encouraging people to volunteer for the military. In short, “[t]he social role of waged work has been so naturalized as to seem necessary and inevitable, something that might be tinkered with but never escaped.” (KL 99)</p>
<h3>Idleness</h3>
<blockquote>Longshoremen, like everybody else in the world, like to sit down a lot. When I first came on the waterfront, one of my first jobs was working coffee on the dock. My partner was a black man with a big belly who was getting along in years. When we turned to that morning the gangs on the ship had to rig the booms and uncover the hatches, so we had a little time before we got our first load. My partner spent that time searching around collecting two-by-fours and other scraps of lumber. Finally I got tired of watching him and asked him what he was doing. He did not reply at first, but busied himself with poking the lumber into a stack of pallet boards just inside the door of the shed, beside the ship. Finally he had four two-by-fours sticking out at a convenient height above the floor, and he turned around and sat down on them. He had two one-by-eights protruding out on either side of him, a little higher than the two-by-fours, for arm rests. His fingers were laced together across the front of him, comfortably holding up his big belly.

"Son, you haven't been down here very long, have you?" he said, looking at me speculatively.

"No, I haven't," I acknowledged.

"Well, boy, I'm going to tell you how to get along on this waterfront. When you come to work in the morning, the first thing you do is construct yourself a good seat. And the second thing you do is make sure you use it a lot."

In this world, sometimes the best of advice just drops in your lap. (42-43)
<p style="text-align: right;">--<em>Reg Theriault</em>, How to Tell When You're Tired:
A Brief Examination of Work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on your frame of mind, you will smile or frown at this longshoreman’s working-day motto. You can either sympathize with his desire for rest, given the sheer physicality of the work – especially as it existed in the middle decades of the last century – or you can sympathize with his employer, who is not paying for him to rest but to work. Or, I suppose, you might wonder at the existence of jobs where sitting was the exception, not the norm, and even wish for one.</p>

<p>Work, by definition, is not always easy or pleasurable, but it is necessary. But how this necessity is understood, and who decides it, is a matter of context. When you are plowing a field in order to eat, or making a horseshoe to sell in order to buy other things you need, the parameters of the necessary are self-evident. But when someone is paying you to unload coffee from a ship in exchange for a day’s wages, the necessary becomes harder to parse. If the ship gets unloaded in a reasonable time, within the schedule of the larger workings of the dock, to whom is it necessary that the longshoremen do not sit down on the job, or only do so at prescribed, negotiated intervals? The logic of capitalism doesn’t work like the logic of toil… capitalism wants as much work as possible for its money, while any individual knows that the less he toils, the better.</p>

<p>Theriault’s memoir of his life as a manual laborer in this country is as laugh-out-loud funny as it is rigorously insightful. Part stories, part reflections, Theriault gives us a slice of the history of the worker, a history he notes that, on a global, millennial scale, has largely been lost beyond recuperation. The book provides a glimpse into the nature of work as an <em>activity</em> engaged in by workers and its complex interactions with the <em>idea</em> of work promulgated by the people who hire and manage workers. As can be imagined, often the ideas about work don’t fit very well with work itself. What seems logical in theory – greater efficiency, greater productivity, increased automation, lower labor costs – doesn’t always make for better work, either in practice or in outcome.</p>

<p>Spending so much time around my house these days, I have time to stare out the window, idle. A rather sizable spider has made a web outside my front door, in the 90-degree space between the side of the house and the eaves. She sits, sometimes in the middle of the net, sometimes hidden in a corner by the house. She waits as mosquitos and other flying food sources meet their doom. She reacts nervously as the web shakes when I raise the mailbox lid (to which the web is attached). She has lain eggs in sacs of silk; we have seen some of them hatch (creepy). One evening, I watched as she tended the sacs and rewove parts of the web that had deteriorated. I tried to imagine what it would be like to be a spider, one who does what we would call work without the mental framework to theorize it. What is work, or idleness, when you are driven purely by instinct? Living, perhaps?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*        *        *</p>
<p>I keep occupied, and I feel busy, but I miss work. I miss the money, I miss the workday rhythm, and I miss the subtle feeling of satisfaction – so American! – of “going to work,” a feeling that somehow manages to creep in no matter how much I might also hate the job itself.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I will work again, as I’m still at the relatively early end of my working years. And let’s face it, people my age are probably never going to be able to retire, or at least not in the way of our grandparents and parents.</p>

<p>I try to think stoically in those moments when the isolation gets to me, I remind myself that “this too shall pass,” and I remind myself to focus on how lucky I am, compared to many.</p>

<p>And I think of the spider, waiting, and weaving when needed.</p>
