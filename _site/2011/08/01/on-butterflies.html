  <p>There’s only three things for sure: taxes, death, and trouble.</p>

<h3 id="taxes">Taxes</h3>
<p>So the debt ceiling crisis is over, a deal has been reached. Neither party got what it wanted, although arguably the Democrats lost more, given that essentially all they got was the avoidance of default through the 2012 election. To realize what a Pyrrhic victory this is for the Dems, one need only observe that raising the debt ceiling is something that historically hasn’t ever been, let alone required, a big deal. It’s the equivalent of suddenly having to give your husband a quickie so he’ll do the dishes that he used to do just because you cooked dinner.</p>

<p>Among other things in the deal, the Republicans won on their demand that none of the deficit reducing would be done through increasing government revenues. Look at that, Marvin, taxes aren’t for sure! Give this Congress another year or two, maybe they’ll repeal the Sixteenth Amendment, the one that established the right of the federal government to levy an income tax.</p>

<p>I don’t think that everyone, or even most people, are ever going to feel overjoyed about paying taxes. But at one point in this country, the very wealthy at least accepted that they had to pay taxes at a fairly high rate on the upper part of their income (the relevant term of art here is marginal tax rates). That was just a basic premise, and lowering such taxes rates on these folks was not a major part of either party’s platform, let alone a key plank in a bass-ackwards theory that maintains that keeping taxes low on corporations and the super rich creates jobs.</p>

<p>Say something enough times, though, and it starts to sound important, and then it starts to sound true. I believe this is what has happened in the case of the Republicans. Arguably, they are protecting their own money and that of their political contributors, but they are doing so with a rabid fury that cannot be motivated merely by even the most pernicious greed. As so often happens in our lives, we form our convictions based not on experience but on anticipation of experiences, i.e., fear and dread. Meaning, in short, that thinking about paying more taxes is worse than actually paying more taxes ever really was.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that it felt great <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/fed_individual_rate_history-20110323.pdf">40 years ago (1971) to be taxed</a> more regressively (up to a marginal rate of 70% on your income over $200,000). But not only was it rare (because so few people earned that much money), it was considered entirely normal. And normal is really what matters, i.e., it’s not the policy that matters so much as your attitude toward the policy. Not to mention the fact that if you are a family grossing $95,100 (which is what households in the 95th percentile of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Household_income">median income were earning in 1970</a>) and taking home $52,850, you have a lot more in common with people earning $35,900 and keeping $25,600. This regressive marginal tax scheme doesn’t equalize the two household incomes, but takes them from a ratio of 2.64 to 1 down to 2.06 to 1. Yes, the wealthier family is surrendering a greater percentage of its overall income (44% versus 29%), but in exchange it is gaining a larger interest in the common good. If you don’t have as much purchasing power in the private market, you are naturally more interested in the public commons, such as decent public schools, government services, and Social Security benefits. I’m not going to say that this is fair, but I am going to say that it serves an identifiable, functional purpose: this way, the wealthy and the average are in it together, and that makes you more sure of one another.</p>

<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>Terrence Malick’s <em>The Tree of Life</em> is a movie about God, at least according to white people. Not that the Creator of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s <em>Strength to Love</em> can’t be discerned somewhere in there, but let’s just say that civil rights and social justice are peripheral to this film, which poses the question of the human-divine relationship within the more narrow context of a mother’s grief over the death of her middle child, one son of three born and raised in the stern yet precious America of the 1950s (specifically, that of suburban Texas).</p>

<p>I confess I adore this film, even though I think it would have been better had Malick forced himself to cut out 15 minutes or so, including the scene with the dinosaurs by the river. Film, which is inherently a distillation of life though its use of metonymy (part for whole; i.e., an entire life is suggested through the presentation of select scenes), is perhaps the ideal medium for a meditation on spirituality, for spirituality is often understood as a distillation of our own existence, a reduction of the experience of life to its essential feelings and, if you are so inclined, meaning.
The film is beautiful in its vagueness, in the fact that we are left guessing why R.L. (the only name given to the middle son, and this only in the credits) died at 19. My guess is Vietnam, but this is pure conjecture. What is certain is that it is essential to this film’s work to depoliticize death in the same way that it idealizes life – both must take on spiritual and even archetypal aspects. This is not a film of small questions, or of petty emotions – how could a film with a epigraph from the Book of Job be such?</p>

<p>But the film is also beautiful in its directness. It does not pretend not to be a spiritual film. From the first voiceover of the riveting, understated Jessica Chastain as the future Mrs. O’Brien (see above), Malick boldly shows his hand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nuns taught us there were two ways through life: the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you’ll follow. Grace doesn’t try to please itself. Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked. Accepts insults and injuries. Nature only wants to please itself. Get others to please it too. Likes to lord it over them. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things. The nuns taught us that no one who loves the way of grace ever comes to a bad end. I will be true to you. Whatever comes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what comes, sure enough, is trouble.</p>

<h3 id="trouble">Trouble</h3>
<p>There are commercials that depress me, several in particular. One is an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5UQkwCuB90">iPhone commercial</a> in which this woman is using said device to cheat on a radio quiz game (after lying that she hasn’t played before). With her ability to browse the Internet and talk on the phone simultaneously, she is able to answer the question about America’s deepest lake with a bored ease, after which she is faced with the list of prizes she can choose from, all of which she already has, of course. With the same bored resignation, she chooses a second bouncy castle.</p>

<p>The other one is also a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wkHsiL4Enc">smartphone commercial</a>, this time advertising Sprint’s HTC EVO 3D, the first phone that shoots and plays 3D video (no glasses required). Some kids are playing ping-pong, and the father is videoing them with his phone. Quickly he decides that the way they are playing isn’t taking advantage of the potential of the 3D capabilities, so he switches places and returns a slam on (presumably) his son’s serve. When his daughter, who is holding the phone, asks him, understandably, wtf that was, he replies, “That was 3D gold.” Because it’s all about the phone, apparently.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if am building for myself a reputation on this blog as a sort of a neo-Luddite, although obviously not the kind that rejects technology outright: I have a blog, I adore my iPhone, I can’t imagine life without the Internet. I guess I am the kind of neo-Luddite that senses a lamentable, generalized effect of technology on our society and culture. I don’t want computers and the Internet to go away, but I also don’t want to be made to desire a 3D phone or television just because some corporation needs to make most of us buy another gadget so it can continue to make money. And believe me, I wear no rose-colored glasses about my ability to resist advertising and marketing. I could care less about TV, really, but when I go home I tease my parents fairly relentlessly about not owning even one set that can handle high definition. So in short, what depresses me about those commercials is not that I am some strange outlier; rather, it is the fact that, but for the grace of God, surely there go I.</p>
