  <p>When you’ve met one autistic child, you’ve meet one autistic child.</p>

<h3 id="seeing">Seeing</h3>
<p>Temple Grandin is perhaps the most famous person currently living with autism. Autism, or more properly put, Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a diagnosis that describes a neurobiological disorder that results in various developmental disorders. The range of impairments, both in arena (social, motor, sensory, intellectual/cognitive) and severity, is so great, however, that truly meeting one child with autism gives you an idea of <em>that</em> child and <em>his</em> (less likely hers) autism. One child may communicate verbally, another may be entirely non-verbal. One child may crave physical attention, another may not tolerate human-to-human contact. A high-functioning autistic may be able to live relatively independently as an adult, while many will need high-level, lifelong care. </p>

<p>But movies must be made about individuals, not about diagnoses. The HBO film <em>Temple Grandin</em> gives us an incredible outlier of autism in its brilliant protagonist who came of age at a time when autism was much less understood (as for schizophrenia, the “refrigerator mother” was blamed) and also much less prevalent. While the former circumstance provides plenty of opportunities for those wistful “but now we know better” moments, the latter one allows us (indeed, the film encourages us) to see Grandin through a lens that can only be described as anti-diagnostic. When we meet her, she is a young adult who appears outwardly as a conforming member of 1960s society; even if her aunt needs to remind Temple to mind her manners, she is not one of a type, and she is not spoken of in terms of her autism by her aunt and mother—even if, as we see later in flashback, she was given the autism diagnosis as a child, and exhibited many of the commonly associated behaviors (verbal delay, tantrums, avoidance of physical contact, extreme pickiness with food).</p>

<p>But Grandin is exceptional, not only as a person with autism, but as a person. Although she does not talk until age four, she becomes verbally fluent and is not physically or cognitively impaired; quite the contrary, the way her brain processes the world through images gives her incredible visual-spatial abilities. She can see things in the world, and see them in her mind, and navigate between these two worlds with incredible ease and precision. The film’s use of special effects (mostly schematic or graphic overlays onto images of the real world) masterfully put us into Grandin’s mind, allowing us to experience how it is she sees. It is with this skill that she redesigns her aunt and uncle’s ranch gate to open at the pull of a rope and close automatically, allowing 47 seconds to drive through.
While autism is associated with heightened abilities in certain areas (“savant” gifts, as they were called in the era of <em>Rainman</em>), Grandin’s ability to communicate and express her unique vision makes her an extremely high-functioning autistic, a clear outlier. Despite the obviously rote quality of her ”I’mTempleGrandin nicetomeetyou,” her discomfort with physical contact with others, and her obliviousness to social cues and practices, she is engaged in the world around her—particularly with the world of animals, from which she receives as much as she later will give in her work on animal behavior and techniques for humane treatment of stockyard cattle. It is from the management of cows that she borrows the notion of gentling, discovering that the application of pressure on her body calms and relaxes her during her attacks of anxiety or sensory overwhelm. Though she has to fight to keep her custom-designed “hugging machine” in her college dorm room, the film makes clear not only that Grandin’s relationship to her condition is extremely rare, even unique, but also that she faces equal if not greater obstacles from society, specifically, the intense sexism in the cattle-ranching industry.</p>

<p>As for Grandin’s attitude toward her condition, it is marked by a supreme self-awareness. While the film surely expects us to cringe as the doctor explains to her Harvard-educated mother the theory of maternal lack of affection in “childhood schizophrenia” (aka autism), this scene can be considered the straw man to the later scene in which a bumbling Freudian psychologist mistakes Temple’s literalism (her notion of “release” is not orgasm, but the point at which she releases herself from the grip of the machine) for an admission that she derives sexual pleasure from her hugging machine. Not only is he wrong, but Temple herself is blissfully immune from any of his implications of shame. The result is pure comedy, at the expense of the diagnostic establishment.</p>

<p>As in the early part of the film, however, an essential feature of this antediluvian world of knowledgeable diagnosis is Temple’s personal awareness of the necessity of self-mastery. She is obviously different, but her relationship to the world is not governed by a sense that it should accomodate her. If stores are going to get automatic doors, she is going to have learn to go through them. Again here, it should be emphasized that Grandin is an outlier on the autism spectrum, having not only the insight to know what she can and cannot learn—she knows, for instance, that she will never be able to learn how to read the communicative signals of the human glance—but also possessing the capacity to learn to cope with her condition, to face down her fears. The hugging machine helps, but she knows that on occasion she will have to manage her anxiety without it. She prefers not to be touched by people, but she can overcome this in certain circumstances, for instance, to assist her blind college roommate. In this way, the film is able to transform Temple Grandin’s particular struggle with her unique form of autism into a more general case of triumph over difficult circumstance of whatever variety.</p>

<p>A lesser known film, <em>Under the Piano</em>, takes us even further back in time, beginning in 1930s New York. As the title suggests, the protagonist of this film is much less accessible than the communicative Grandin. The young Rosetta Basilio is one of many children born into a musical family, but she does not speak and is prone to anxious and sometimes self-injurious fits. Her mother loves her, but looks at her condition as a limitation, a perspective that is somewhat self-serving, as she will increasingly (as her other children go out into the world) use Rosetta’s dependence as a definition of her own identity. Rosetta’s next-older sister, Franny, however, who herself must learn to cope with the disability of a lame arm, sees her sister as needing not just care but also room to flourish. Rosetta is extremely musically talented, but while her mother dismisses her abilities as mere mimicry, absent of feeling, Franny cannot fail to see her sister’s intelligence and compassion. In a wonderful dinner scene, while the family bickers over Rosetta’s condition (which of course is not discussed in diagnostic terms), she silently cuts up all the meat on her plate and then stealthily switches her own plate with her sister’s, thus relieving Franny of a task made difficult by her useless hand.</p>

<p>This care dyad between the two sisters manages to overcome a communicative gulf that is unflinchingly presented—Rosetta is barely verbal, and when she speaks she is prone to echolalia, meaning she often repeats what is said to her rather than giving proper responses. She is very much “in her own world,” as is often said about autistic persons, but Franny knows where the overlap is between her sister’s world and that of the rest of us, and encourages the meeting of the two, whether it be by taking her to the opera or finding them both work in a Catholic hospital cafeteria—where it is discovered that, in addition to her musical gifts, Rosetta has exceptional fine motor control, and can quickly, neatly, and contentedly prepare the innumerable sandwiches served in the wards above.</p>

<p>Things fall apart, however, when Franny gets married and leaves for the west coast, leaving Rosetta in the increasingly self-serving care of her mother. When Rosetta breaks her leg, her mother does everything she can to discourage her recovery (which she equates with abandonment), and her own depression eventually suggests (knowingly?) suicide to Rosetta, who drinks ammonia one night in imitation of the death scene in her favorite opera, <em>La Forza del Destino</em>.</p>

<p>Franny, who serves as a force stronger than destiny in her sister’s life, arrives for a visit just in time to drag her to the hospital and save her life, first by preventing her death, but later by insuring that she does not disappear into the nascent netherworld of «modern» psychiatry, defined by institutions and straightjackets and unspecified interventions—scary quotes indeed, those! While the misguided and harmful treatment of mental patients during this period is well known, the film’s choice to contrast Rosetta’s autism with the blank stare of a lobotomized woman (the word is not spoken, but we of course know) firmly insists that whatever the apparent distance between Rosetta and the world, it is to the world that she indeed belongs.</p>

<p>Here is the way in which this story, like that of Temple Grandin, is also exceptional. Rosetta, though possessing an uncommon musical ability, is in many ways representative of a larger autistic population, as is unable to be entirely self-sufficient. What set her story apart is her sister’s exceptional care and companionship, which provides her with a comfortable, (relatively) autonomous, and satisfying life. The film’s final shots, of Rosetta playing the piano as her mother lies dead beside (almost under) it, brings us full circle to the earlier scene from which the movie takes its title, namely that of a young Rosetta hanging out under the piano as it was played. She has outlived her mother, but more importantly she has survived her mother’s well-intentioned but restrictive notion of care. She has flourished.</p>

<h3 id="being">Being</h3>
<p>In the bright sun of summer, in the glare of persistent ignorance, the daily reality of diagnosis and its accompaniments is glorious, but the right hand of the camera turns away from what is left.
More of what I know is from sitting and serving in a state of redundancy. I sang a lot, and became aware of how many lyrics from the songs of my childhood I had forgotten, even though the melodies remained, like loyal old friends.</p>

<p>My mother told me recently of a time when I was young, and we were at a park, and a man asked her why she was teaching me animal sounds. Because, she replied, automatic like a See-N-Say, that is what you do. But then she thought about it more and wondered why indeed.</p>

<p>One early time I forgot to run an errand because my mind was so full, so blank, I just drove home on autopilot.</p>

<p>These children… we made them a group, and in my terrible triage I learned their names instead of those of the women around me, those wise, persistent, humble women. There was no restriction on me to love, and so I did. I watched mysteries unfold and persist and picked up some tricks and only later than you’d think, noticed the soft scars on a hand too often bit.</p>

<p>As expected, there wasn’t a lot of gaze-meeting, but there was a lot of hugging, of hand-holding, of laughing and jumping, coaxing, and one-sided conversations that went as the hands on a clock. Beginnings without greetings, and endings without goodbyes. Swings.</p>

<p>I mean no cruelty, but we are all a bit slaves to our perceptions, and they come up from the ships’ galleys and report unflinchingly that no one is home, or so it seems. I puzzled over an expression that seemed identical to that of an overstressed, high-powered academic I knew, except B.D. had no context I could know that could account for that acute frown.</p>

<p>The most crucial ingredient in beauty is superfluity. And America doesn’t have a lot of faith in, or practice at, enforcing an aesthetic. We keep order, and make cubicles, and we show up, but personally I wanted to be—and still do want—more of a <em>vigilante</em>.</p>

<p>I reject evaluation for myself and for these children, these adults, the former that will become just by waiting the latter. All measure of contribution is negotiable, and I no more will be put on someone’s bottom line than I will put someone else there. Am I the only person disgusted by <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/health/video-peter-bell-on-handling-the-upcoming-needs-of-autistic-adults/10806/">Peter Bell arguing for why autistics can make valuable employees</a>? No one has ever been saved by the (closing) bell.</p>

<p>The best advocates understand their own uselessness, and how to smile for no reason.
The first denial comes from too much love, from the sinews of recognition, the persistence of willingness. The final denial, <a href="http://being.publicradio.org/programs/2011/autism-and-humanity/">at the end of a long discussion</a>, came to me as a punch in the stomach… the assertion that their autistic boy would “always need services.”</p>

<p>You service a car, or a sewing machine. Throw all the denial at me you want, but the necessity is that of care.</p>
