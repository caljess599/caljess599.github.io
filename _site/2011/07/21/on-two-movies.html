<p>For a place founded on a philosophy and experience of rebirth, second chances, and revivals—in short, of <em>betterment</em>—it seems odd that contemporary America consistently promotes the young to fame—and often, accompanying fortune. We have young athletes, young singers, and young inventors… including Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook and subject of last year’s award-winning biopic, <em>The Social Network.</em></p>

<p>I saw this film with my father a little over 9 months ago. It is engrossing and witty, neatly capturing the ethos of the early 2000s during which the age of the the Internet became the age of Social Networking, a phenomenon first limited to the young, but now considered indispensable by soccer moms, grandmas, small business owners, self-promoters, and, of course, corporate America.</p>

<p>Knowing in advance that Zuckerberg’s creative blitz of code-writing ends, eventually, in the banal “find us on Facebook” refrain, we cannot help but watch the initial scenes of inspiration with a touch of chagrin. For me, this chagrin was mixed with a strange kind of nostalgia, the recall of younger days in which I believed that the combined blessings of youth and brilliance were unstoppable forces of good, and that if I recognized and loved a boy’s keen mind, that his heart would bear gifts to match: compassion, insight, and kindness.</p>

<p>Creativity, alas, no more guarantees happiness than a seed-head scattered by a girl’s breath promises a patch of dandelions. Come down through the cosmos, inspiration’s energies are invisibile, winding their wild ways not in allegiance to the artist’s vision but to the much vaster entropy of Source. Watching Andrew Garfield (playing Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZRr4KV59I">write out critical algorithms</a> (for Zuckerberg’s beer- and revenge-fueled FaceMash) on the window of Zuckerberg’s dorm room, thus visually manifesting the wondrously strange, almost magical (to me, anyway, as an ignorant outsider) process of computer programming, I felt keenly the contrast between that foreshadowing of Zuckerberg’s programming triumph and the state of confusion that reigned in my own creative life.</p>

<p><em>The Social Network</em> tells the story of creative success, certainly, but at high social cost. The tangled web Zuckerberg weaves out of code and social curiosity disrupts as much as it purports to connect, drags him down as much as it elevates him to worldwide recognition and sky-high net worth. As the brothers Winklevoss learn, something is rotten in the state of preppy-dom; Harvard president Larry Summers represents the academy—supposed last bastion of gentlemanly honor and fair play—as tone-deaf to the brothers’ concerns of integrity over a website that doesn’t sell anything. The latter phenomenon is too new, while the complaint of ungentlemanly conduct is too old, and has been lost in the academy’s conversion from self-effacement to self-promotion. The doorknobs may be old, but even the old-boy network needs new money. Summers has bigger fish to fry than settle what appears to him as a playground dispute brought by whiny children.</p>

<p>Disputes over the genesis of technological inventions are as old as inventing itself; the Wright Brothers and Samuel F. B. Morse, for example, struggled as mightily with patent law and profiteers as they did with planes and port-rules. Neither self-propelled flight nor magnetic telegraphy was invented in a vacuum, without partnership and cross-pollination. In that sense the legal notion of inventorship is a convenient fiction, but perhaps the inconvenient truth of this last century’s turn is the way in which friendship itself has been redefined not only by the process of invention but by its products. With friends like Zuckerberg… well, you need a lawyer.</p>

<p>And so the lawyers brought everyone to the table, listened to the stories, and taped band-aids of undisclosed millions over the wounds, real or imagined, of Facebook’s creators, actual and potential.</p>

<p>With this cautionary tale, my own rescue mission began.</p>

<h3 id="mission-accomplished">Mission Accomplished</h3>
<p>The other night, my father and I took a much-deserved break from our DIT projects (that’s DIY, but “together” instead of “yourself”) and the mugginess of Virginia summer to watch the film <em>Super 8</em>. It was the only choice, since everything else playing (not counting <em>Midnight in Paris</em>, which my dad had already seen) was either animated or asinine. (I’ll have to go see <em>Cars 2</em> by myself I guess!)</p>

<p>So with popcorn and drink and no more than a dozen other people in the theater, we slipped into the narcotic haze of cinematic narrative, letting the air conditioning cool our bodies and the digital images redirect our imaginations.</p>

<p><em>Super 8</em> is also a film about creating—indeed, it is about making a 8mm movie—but it is a creation of a different time and place. It is 1979: the Walkman is new, the Russians may be coming, but the real Bad Guy is the US Air Force that has tortured a monstrous-looking alien being that accidentally crashed to earth years before, refusing to let it go because it has this magical building material that it can morph, apparently through mental power alone, into anything, including the most amazing spacecraft ever seen. In this sense, the film is doubly about creation, because the alien is being held prisoner due to the interest the military takes in his creative ability, determined to steal what it cannot invent itself.</p>

<p>The two plots intersect when the movie-making kids witness the daring attempt to free the alien by their biology teacher, Dr. Woodward, by derailing the Air Force train in which he and his magical creative cubes are being transported. A former scientist on the Air Force team that imprisoned him, Woodward has since been working to free the alien, having experienced a mystical communion with him when the alien picked him up. “As soon as he touched me, I knew,” he recounts for the tapes he keeps in his secret “dungeon,” a trailer behind the school. Without words, the alien was able to communicate to Woodward that all he wanted was to go home, and his anger was only a response to the frustration and confusion of his captivity.</p>

<p>This bonding moment is repeated between our young protagonist Joe Lamb and the alien, at the film’s climax, when the motherless (due to an accident at the Lillian steel mill) Joe is grabbed by the huge monster. He, too, knows instantaneously the alien’s agony, and soberly is able to reassure him that, although bad things happen, you can start again… there are second chances. Maybe not second chances for those who have died, but for the living there can be love again, just as the alien can finally go home.</p>

<p>It is this same optimism that guides Joe’s best friend, Charles Kaznyk, in his film hobby. The film-within-the-film, <em>The Case</em>, is a zombie murder horror/detective movie with a happy ending, and is the young director’s submission to the Cleveland, Ohio <em>International</em> Teenage Super-8 Movie Contest. There is an innocence about the presentation of this final gasping breath of the 1970s, where houses were messy but mothers cooked, kids bickered but the family was still happy, and no one had A.D.H.D. or was obese (pudgy Charlie just hasn’t “leaned out yet” as the doctor puts it). Kids were kids, and they snuck out of the house, drove their parents cars without licenses or permission, but nothing terrible was going to happen to them. Even when they witness the most incredible train wreck, the blood at the scene is Charlie’s fake movie blood, and they return home dirty and freaked out but otherwise no worse for the wear.</p>

<p>Watching Charlie’s enthusiasm for writing, shooting, developing the film (entailing a minimum 3-day turn-around), and editing it (cut and splice!), we feel appropriately nostalgic for this age-of-innocence creativity story. There is a wholesomeness that seems to attach itself retrospectively to older creative technology; the age of the 8mm film is presented as an age of patience and dedication in spite of (what we now see as) technological limitations, selfless collaboration (Joe feels obligated, by virtue of his friendship, to help Charlie finish his movie), and pure motives—the film is created as art-for-art’s sake, with the goal of recognition of a kind that now seems positively archaic: review by a select few for the granting of a prize.</p>

<p>Compared to the instant viralization of video today, how effortless a moving image can be recorded, edited and disseminated, the late ’70s teenage filmmaker and his volunteer posse is offered up to us as part of a larger antediluvian vision of American culture. Past and present dangers, such as Vietnam and Three Mile Island accident, are acknowledged peripherally, but the trouble and triumph of the film is represented in the liberation of the creative alien and the completion—old friendships and precious model trains still intact—of <em>The Case.</em> Creating, from filmmaking to modeling (which is Charlie’s apt description of the before-our-eyes composition of the alien’s incredible spaceship) is not only magical, it is the source of good that is intuited at a level beyond speech: “As soon as it touched me, I knew.”</p>

<p>And so Alice is rescued, and the misunderstood artist is free, at last, to create and to go home.</p>

<p>A happy ending—or rather, a new beginning.</p>

<p><em>Thanks, Dad, for coming to see these movies with me. You know the good you have done.</em></p>
