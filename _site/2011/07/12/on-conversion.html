<p>The beauty of taking something on faith is its fortitude in the face of changing circumstances – through the storms of experience, faith provides a stalwart buttress to our vulnerable resolve.</p>

<p>But few are those for whom faith comes easily in all matters, and so we must instead bear the tempest of experience until we acquire mastery. For me, one of my greatest fears was that the human body did not float in water. Or rather, that <em>my</em> body did not.</p>

<p>This doubt persisted through years of (fruitless) swim lessons, and only abated one summer, when, as a teenager, I spent a lot of time in the water, and one day casually realized that, indeed, like everyone else’s, my body did indeed float.</p>

<p>But this casual conversion was merely the beginning of a much longer road to mastery, mastery of technique and mastery of fear. I took swimming lessons in graduate school (I often joke that that was the most useful thing I got out of my doctoral education) and then about two years ago, went back to the pool as an exercise regime. While my foggy memories of grad school instruction gave me enough courage to improve my comfort and stamina in the water, it was only through private lessons that I was able to genuinely learn the proper technique, and to discover the bliss that comes from a supreme confidence in the pool. Moves that had once seemed impossible to me (flip turns, for example) were now becoming a routine part of my workout. And each day, I am still improving.</p>

<h3 id="moving-on">Moving on</h3>
<p>After 55 years in a house in central New Jersey, my grandparents are moving. Not only are we saying goodbye to this house, full of countless memories, my grandmother and I are saying goodbye to “the lake,” the nearby pond that has served as a fixture of her life, and my summertimes here, for decades. My grandmother, a woman who just a year shy of 90 could be mistaken for a woman in her 70s, swam daily after work in that lake, simply because she loved that water, and the energy that exercise gave her. Since I was a little kid, it was not just the water that drew her there, but the company of the “ladies of the lake,” a group of women, mostly divorcÃ©es a few years her junior, who have gabbed away the afternoons, moving to follow the shade, passing around treats, and providing sympathy and congratulations through their lives’ many burdens and blessings.</p>

<p>And so it was a week of goodbyes and good luck wishing, as my grandmother moves south, away from this longest of summer traditions. It was goodbye for me, too, but it was also a thrilling few days, marked so appropriately by the Independence Day holiday. After all of those years confined, humiliatingly, to the shallows, I went and swam the lake proper, fearlessly, effortlessly, gliding through that water as my grandmother did decades ago, delighting in its natural warm and cold spots, and enjoying its refreshing cool under a shining summer sun.</p>

<p>And I can’t remember what it feels like to be scared of the water. I can remember <em>being</em> that way, but I cannot summon the physical fear I once had. The water will hold me. I take it on faith.</p>

<h3 id="we-of-little-faith">“We” of little faith</h3>
<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">RadioLab</a> this weekend, and the theme was <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2010/jun/28/">Oops</a>, that is, the unintended consequences of various human endeavors, from the comical (automatic find-replace editing in newspapers and the like) to the catastrophic (the death of the world’s oldest tree; the Mack Lake fire). One segment included a description of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2000/06/chase.htm">a multi-year experiment conducted on a group of Harvard undergraduates</a> beginning in the fall of 1959 by an eminent professor in the Department of Social Relations, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Murray">Henry A. Murray</a>.</p>

<p>As part of this experiment, subjects were asked to write an essay in which they expressed their deepest convictions, hopes, and ambitions. They also took a multitude of tests and gave detailed revelations of their most intimate thoughts, feelings, and fantasies. After being told they would meet to discuss their essay with another student, they were instead subjected to brutal interrogations in which they and their ideals were abusively attacked. In subsequent meetings, they had to watch the video footage that was made of their (predictable) meltdown during the initial interrogation.</p>

<p>One of the students who participated (with consent, but not with what is today known as informed consent) was a very young sophomore named Theodore J. Kaczynski, a gifted student who would go on to become a tenured mathematics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Subsequently, however, he withdrew into the Montana wilderness and, beginning in 1978, started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski#Bombings">to mail or deliver bombs</a>. Kaczynski is, as you may recall, the terrorist dubbed the Unabomber (in reference to his preferred targets of <em>un</em>iversities and <em>a</em>irlines). Despite a lengthy and costly investigation by the FBI, he was caught only after his brother David recognized the ideas he had long expressed privately in a 35,000 word manifesto (entitled “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm">Industrial Society and its Future</a> that the Unabomber leveraged <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The New York Times</em> into publishing, saying that he would send another bomb if his request was not granted. Since he had already killed 3 people and injured 29 others, the papers, on the advice of the authorities, complied on September 19, 1995.</p>

<p>The author, who identifies himself in the text by the name FC (which Kaczynski later insisted stood for “Freedom Club”), explains why modern (industrial, “organization-dependent”) technology is destroying human experience, and argues for an active revolutionary movement in order to destroy the technology that has taken from human beings not only their natural environment, but also their ability to reliably satisfy their basic goals (i.e., those of survival) through significant effort. FC believes that the autonomous and effortful labor toward our survival is is fundamental to human fulfillment; he refers to these critical needs as the “power process”.</p>

<p>Modern technological society, he argues, has taken away these opportunities, and in so doing has made fulfillment of the power process impossible for most people. We (or at least the incredibly large majority of us) are able to satisfy the basic needs of food, shelter, clothing, etc. with minimal physical or mental effort. The main requirement of keeping a job, FC repeatedly states, is obedience, and as obedience is the opposite of autonomy, it blocks fulfillment of the power process. Therefore we must try to satisfy our need for attainable goals in other ways, with what FC calls “surrogate interests,” which is basically anything that you would no longer do if you were adequately challenged by providing for your survival/social needs on an individual/small group basis. He dismisses the notion of curiosity as the motivator of scientists, who were the Unabomber’s main target:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Science and technology provide the most important examples of surrogate activities. […] As for “curiosity,” that notion is simply absurd. Most scientists work on highly specialized problems that are not the object of any normal curiosity. For example, is an astronomer, a mathematician or an entomologist curious about the properties of isopropyltrimethylmethane? Of course not. Only a chemist is curious about such a thing, and he is curious about it only because chemistry is his surrogate activity. Is the chemist curious about the appropriate classification of a new species of beetle? No. That question is of interest only to the entomologist, and he is interested in it only because entomology is his surrogate activity. If the chemist and the entomologist had to exert themselves seriously to obtain the physical necessities, and if that effort exercised their abilities in an interesting way but in some nonscientific pursuit, then they wouldn’t give a damn about isopropyltrimethylmethane or the classification of beetles. Suppose that lack of funds for postgraduate education had led the chemist to become an insurance broker instead of a chemist. In that case he would have been very interested in insurance matters but would have cared nothing about isopropyltrimethylmethane. In any case it is not normal to put into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the amount of time and effort that scientists put into their work. The “curiosity” explanation for the scientists’ motive just doesn’t stand up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For FC, the generating of such specialized knowledge is an almost perverse surrogate for the more basic experiences of a more “primitive,” small-scale, and nature-connected lifestyle. FC idealizes this kind of lifestyle, and gives a rather layman’s analysis as to why that way of living is more conducive to human happiness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In primitive societies life is a succession of stages. The needs and purposes of one stage having been fulfilled, there is no particular reluctance about passing on to the next stage. A young man goes through the power process by becoming a hunter, hunting not for sport or for fulfillment but to get meat that is necessary for food. (In young women the process is more complex, with greater emphasis on social power; we won’t discuss that here.) This phase having been successfully passed through, the young man has no reluctance about settling down to the responsibilities of raising a family. (In contrast, some modern people indefinitely postpone having children because they are too busy seeking some kind of “fulfillment.” We suggest that the fulfillment they need is adequate experience of the power process—with real goals instead of the artificial goals of surrogate activities.) Again, having successfully raised his children, going through the power process by providing them with the physical necessities, the primitive man feels that his work is done and he is prepared to accept old age (if he survives that long) and death. Many modern people, on the other hand, are disturbed by the prospect of physical deterioration and death, as is shown by the amount of effort they expend trying to maintain their physical condition, appearance and health. We argue that this is due to unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never put their physical powers to any practical use, have never gone through the power process using their bodies in a serious way. It is not the primitive man, who has used his body daily for practical purposes, who fears the deterioration of age, but the modern man, who has never had a practical use for his body beyond walking from his car to his house. It is the man whose need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best prepared to accept the end of that life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FC’s idea of fulfillment, of self-realization, to introduce a term he does not use, but that seems appropriate, is very much concerned with physical, immediate experience – the satisfaction of immediate needs, and an interaction with nature that, he argues, results in humans being comfortable with the changes that any creature, by definition, must undergo within its lifespan. FC is unhappy, and his commitment to calculated, cold-blooded terrorism plainly evidences his anger. Yet the kind of lifestyle he imagines that the abandonment of technology would make possible is downright idyllic, one in which human beings are no longer plagued by the pervasive anxieties of modern life. In this sense, FC is a despairing optimist: he has the capacity to imagine man (in the abstract) living well in his environment, but he lacks hope that these conditions can be realized in reality – even for himself.</p>

<p>Indeed, the saddest part of FC’s manifesto has to be the palpable sense of loneliness it exudes. Here he is, fearless champion of boys who would rather run around outside than study science, proponent of a back-to-the-land, small-group (extended family, local community) social units – in short, he is a dreamer committed to principles upon which a solid, satisfying life could undoubtedly be built (and, to a certain extent, were indeed built in the past). But in reality Kaczynski lived as a hermit in the Montana backwoods, and felt clearly doomed to obscurity by the very technology that seems to have (apparently) convinced the rest of us that we can have a voice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups. Take us (FC) for example. If we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted. If they had been been accepted and published, they probably would not have attracted many readers, because it’s more fun to watch the entertainment put out by the media than to read a sober essay. Even if these writings had had many readers, most of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read as their minds were flooded by the mass of material to which the media expose them. In order to get our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression, we’ve had to kill people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think this is true, and probably neither do you. But Kaczynski does. And one cannot help but wonder how much of a hand the (ominously-named) Department of Social Relations at Harvard had in the formation of the imaginary “Freedom Club,” the club of one. Its “we” is a sadly ironic version of the old “royal we,” as well as its post-Revolutionary equivalent, “we the people.” FC is someone whose faith in humanity has been shattered, leaving only behind a rhetorical remnant of a sympathy toward, and solidarity with, fellow human beings. To dismiss this response (as has been done in Kaczynski’s case) as the exclusive product of biochemical aberration (i.e., mental illness) not only promotes not only a cruel, inaccurate association between violence and mental illness, but also denies the importance of our obligations toward one another as social beings.</p>

<h3 id="faith-and-reason">Faith and Reason</h3>
<p>If the hallmark of philosophy is to theorize what is true in general, in the abstract, the marker of the conversion experience is in the recognition of one’s own particularity – that one lives in a specific place and circumstance.</p>

<p>The liberating potential of this realization is the beauty behind Leo Tolstoy’s religious transformation, in which he goes from a depressed and suicidal man of no faith to a Christian believer. He chronicles this conversion in his book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=D7kGiJpUOxgC"><em>A Confession</em></a>. First, he explains the origin of his despair, and the role of reason therein:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I, that is my reason, have acknowledged that life is irrational. If there is nothing higher than reason (and there is not, and nothing can prove that there is), then reason is the creator of life for me. Without reason I can have no life. How then can reason deny life when it is the creator of it? […] Life is everything. Reason is the fruit of life and yet this reason rejects life itself. I felt that something was not quite right here.<br />
Life is a senseless evil, that is certain, I said to myself. Yet I have lived and still live, and so too humanity has lived and still lives. How can this be? Why do men live when it is possible not to live? Can it be that only Schopenhauer and I have been intelligent enough to understand the senselessness and evil of life? <em>(Ch. 7)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tolstoy’s perception that his feelings aren’t shared by a large number of people suggests to him the possibility that, regardless of his internal conviction, he may be missing something. His concept of reason shifts from the notion of individual discernment to an openness to experiences that he has not had, but that need to be considered in the formation of a more complete understanding. He comes to see his reason as not self-endowed, but given to him by collective human life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, since those long ago days when life began and of which I know nothing, people who knew the argument about the vanity of life (which seems to me to prove its senselessness), have nevertheless lived and brought to life a meaning of their own. Ever since there as been some form of human life, people have had this understanding of life, and have pursued this life, and passed it down to me. Everything that is in me and around me is the fruit of their understanding of life. These very instruments of thought with which I judge life, and condemn it, were made by them and not by me. I myself was born, educated and grew up thanks to them. […] They taught me how to think and speak. I am their offspring, provided by them with food and water, taught by them, able to think and speak using their thoughts and words, and now I have proved to them that it is all senseless! “There is something wrong here,” I told myself, “I have made a mistake somewhere.” <em>(Ch. 7)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mistake that he had looked for his answers only among people like himself, and had confused their experience and analysis for total, true knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought that this narrow circle of scholars, and of rich and distinguished people, to which I belonged made up the whole of mankind and that the millions who had lived and still live were THEM, some sort of cattle, people.<br />
It seems so strange to me now, so utterly incomprehensible, that in my reasoning of life I could have overlooked the life of humanity that surrounded me on all sides and that I could have been so ridiculously mistaken as to think that my life, and the life of Solomon and Schopenhauer, was the true, normal life, while the lives of millions was not worthy of attention. [But at the time] I felt so certain that all these millions simply belonged to the category of those who had not yet penetrated the depths of the question, that as I searched for the meaning of my life it never once occurred to think: “What sort of meaning to all the millions who have lived, and do live in the world give to their lives?” <em>(Ch. 8)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once Tolstoy shifts from deduction to induction, from ratiocination to observation, he is able to formulate a new relationship to reason, and thus a new way to seek the answer to his fundamental questions about the meaning of life. He is forced to acknowledge that in addition to rational knowledge, there is also irrational knowledge, which is “possessed by humanity as a whole: faith, which affords the possibility of living.” Rational knowledge is not capable of answering Tolstoy’s questions because, “[t]he only answers the sciences give to this question are identities.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having understood this, I realized that it was impossible to search for an answer to my questions in rational knowledge; that the answer given by rational knowledge simply suggests that the answer can only be obtained by stating the question in another way, by introducing the question of the relation of the finite to the infinite. I realized that no matter how irrational and distorted the answers given by faith might be, they had the advantage of introducing to every answer a relationship between the finite and the infinite, without which there can be no solution. <em>(Ch. 9)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tolstoy breaks with Descartes, knowing that he does not exist because he thinks, but rather that he exists because everything exists, and he is part of the infinite. And he must look toward the varied millions who are also part of this infinite, and learn from them the answers he seeks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I looked more widely around me. I looked at the lives of the multitudes who have lived in the past and who live today. And of those who understood the meaning of life I saw not two, or three, or ten, but hundreds, thousands and millions. And all of them, endlessly varied in their customs, minds, educations and positions, and in complete contrast to my ignorance, knew the meaning of life and death, endured suffering and hardship, lived and died and saw this not as vanity but good. […] It was the activities of the labouring people those who produce life, that presented itself to me as the only true way. I realized that the meaning provided by this life was truth and I accepted it. <em>(Ch. 10)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Faith is the force of life,” Tolstoy writes (in Ch. 9); it is what preserves the wisdom gained throughout history regarding the human relationship to the infinite. Where it resides, and where it must be sought, is not in the individual mind, but in our varied, intertwined, and collective lives.</p>

<p>Faith is a “we,” not an “I”.</p>
