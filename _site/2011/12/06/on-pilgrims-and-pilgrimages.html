  <p>The LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built. And the LORD said, “Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.”</p>

<h3 id="thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</h3>
<p>The fourth Thursday in November is my favorite yearly holiday, because it celebrates everyday pleasures: time off, food, and friends. The “holidays” are often nice in this regard, but the commercial slant that the Christmas season takes wearies me even before November ends. I have never quite understood the strong association between this season and gift-giving; along with well-wishing and good works, it seems that any part of the year would be appropriate for the presentation of a gift to a friend or loved one. I remember learning with great shock that it was at the holiday season that most retailers turned a profit—whence the positive term “Black Friday,” meaning “in the black,” in contrast to its less optimistic usage to describe historically terrible days on Wall Street.</p>

<p>With stores bending over backwards to get customers through the doors, it is perhaps no surprise that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/28/business/retailers-see-surge-in-sales-at-least-early.html?_r=1">record sales were posted for this year</a>’s post-Turkey shopping day. How can this be, in a time of high unemployment and low consumer confidence? Well, as one commentator noted (on the Newshour, I’m pretty sure), many of the people in those lines weren’t going on shopping sprees – they were going to buy the one thing they’d needed or wanted for a while and could only afford during the insane loss-leading sales of Black Friday.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of discussion about poverty lately, as part of the increasing attention to the phenomenon of widening income disparity. Recently, the Census Bureau <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/us/poverty-gets-new-measure-at-census-bureau.html" target="_blank">revised the way it calculates poverty rates</a>, including for the first time costs such as taxes, child care, and medical expenses, as well as accounting for non-cash benefits like food-stamps and the earned income tax credit. By this measure, there are fewer households with children below the poverty line, but more people in the category of the ‘near poor,’ who don’t qualify for benefits.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/19/us/census-measures-those-not-quite-in-poverty-but-struggling.html?pagewanted=2" target="_blank">Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation </a>objects to the use of the term ‘near poverty’ on the grounds that it conjures images of material want that are misleading, preferring the term ‘low-income.’ The rub that Rector would like to ignore with this neutral term is that you don’t have be starving and homeless to struggle with not earning enough money to comfortably cover your bills (let alone save). Indeed, the near poor are in a different but equally difficult dilemma of trying to hang on to the little more (than the poor) they’ve got. As anyone who has experienced it, living paycheck to paycheck – where one unexpected expense (medical bill, car trouble) is enough to knock you off-balance – <em>is</em> a hardship. This remains true even if (like half of the near poor) you are married and own your own home. Twenty-eight percent of the near poor work <em>fulltime</em>.</p>
<h3>The Way</h3>
<p><em>The Way</em>, <a href="http://www.iconmovies.co.uk/theway/" target="_blank">a new film by Emilio Estevez</a>, stars the inimitable Martin Sheen, although the true protagonist of the movie is indeed the route from which it takes its title: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_of_St._James" target="_blank">The Way of St. James</a>, or, in Spanish, El Camino de Santiago. This 1000-year old pilgrimage route – said to retrace the journey traveled by St. James’ remains to his final resting place in the cathedral built for them in Santiago de Compostela – is commonly begun in the French Pyrenees, making for a journey of around 800km (~500mi).</p>

<p>Martin Sheen plays Thomas Avery, whose son Daniel has recently abandoned his pursuit of a PhD in Anthropology. While playing golf, Tom receives word that his son has died in a weather-related accident in France, having just set out to make the pilgrimage (on foot, as is traditional) to Santiago de Compostela. Tom travels to Roncesvalles to pick up the body, but while there he decides to cremate the body and make the pilgrimage with the ashes. In his hasty decision – made possible only by the fact that he has all of the supplies carried by his son – Tom becomes a very unlikely sort of pilgrim, in that his decision is spontaneous and his motivations entirely unrelated to any notion of progress.</p>

<p>As might be expected in a contemporary experience of pilgrimage, the three other pilgrims he collects (rather reluctantly) as traveling companions all have motives related to self-improvement. Joost, an outgoing, charming Dutchman with a soft spot for fine food and wine, is trying to lose weight in time for his brother’s wedding; Sarah, an embittered Canadian divorcee, is trying to quit smoking; Jack, an Irish travel writer, is trying to overcome his writer’s block. Until they all know why Tom is there, they are perplexed by his terse, almost angry manner, which runs contrary to the friendliness that is the hallmark of the non-penitential self-help ethos of the new millennium.</p>

<p>Along the way, the four often turn to a discussion of the pilgrimage itself, and what makes for a genuine pilgrimage, and a true pilgrim: do true pilgrims use bikes? stay in fine hotels? listen to iPods? carry Blackberrys? use credit cards? In a moment of angry grief, Tom ironically proposes his son as the truest pilgrim, for he has given his life along the way. Later, the four watch three monks pass by: two self-flagellating and the third carrying a huge wooden cross. Is any pilgrim truer than another?</p>

<p>The film is beautiful: gorgeous scenery, excellent music, and thoughtful pacing (including an unexpected subplot involving the Roma). For an inevitably spiritual subject matter, it is an unbelievably down-to-earth film – imagine, if you can, the complete opposite of <em><a title="On swatting fliesâ€¦ and butterflies" href="http://www.lightthetunnel.net/?p=87">The Tree of Life</a></em>. I don’t make this comparison randomly; I make it because the <em>Tree of Life</em> is also a spiritual film about grief. Indeed, by the end of the <em>The Way</em>, we learn that all three of Tom’s new friends are in fact making the pilgrimage in order to come to terms with a loss. (Warning: spoiler alert!) Joost, who predictably gains rather than loses weight during the trip, hides behind his joviality his devastation of his wife’s refusal to sleep with him since he’s gained weight; Sarah is mourning the abortion she had to save the child from her abusive ex-husband; even Jack, who is inspired by Tom’s journey to start writing again, is trying to come to terms with the novelist he never became.</p>

<p>And perhaps it is their new understanding of their own grief that finally compels the three to continue with Tom to the sea, where he scatters the remainder of his son’s ashes. Joost no thinner, but happily resigned to buy a new suit for the wedding; Sara still lighting up, acknowledging at last that the journey was never about quitting cigarettes; Jack reconciled to the less-glamorous writerly life–the one that, he now realizes, he has chosen.</p>

<p>And Tom? Well, he just keeps going. There’s progress for you.</p>
