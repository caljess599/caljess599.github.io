        <p>I never got through <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scarlet-Letter-Writings-Critical-Editions/dp/0393979539/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303438940&amp;sr=1-4">The Scarlet Letter</a></em>. I recall falling asleep with the book on my chest during the (lengthy) first scene that describes the Custom-House. There is a movie called <em><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/easy-a/">Easy A</a></em> for which I saw a preview a few months ago that is loosely (hehe) inspired by that American classic, but I’ll resist the urge to wax sophomorically in a compare-and-contrast-vein on colonial and contemporary socio-sexual mores.</p>

<h3 id="inconsistency">Inconsistency</h3>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/12/opinion/12collins.html">recent column</a>, Gail Collins scoffs at Newt Gingrich’s latest incredulity, namely, his citing of his passionate commitment to his political agenda as an explanation for his serial adultery over the course of his two marriages that ended in divorce.</p>

<p>In Gingrich’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There’s no question that at times in my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked far too hard and that things happened in my life that were not appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Vanity Fair’s Bruce Handy <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/03/ten-observations-about-newt-gingrichs-adultery-rationale.html">went on to joke</a>, this is clearly a new view for Gingrich on the subject of marital indiscretion, given his rather different stance on the Lewinsky scandal that led to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. Now that Gingrich is himself planning a run for the presidency, he is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/newt-gingrich-rewrites-history-of-role-in-clinton-impeachment/2011/03/03/AF17PnoB_blog.html">attempting to rewrite the history</a> of his moralizing reaction to Clinton’s behavior during the 1998 midterm elections.</p>

<p>At issue is not the fact that—as subsequently came to light—during the Lewinsky-inspired impeachment trial he was shtupping a congressional aide in her 20s (now wife number three). Rather, the issue is that if he condemned Clinton then, and lets himself off the hook with the excuse of patriotism now, he’s going to be viewed as a hypocrite, i.e., a flip-flopper, which, as <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/29/politics/main646435.shtml">the Kerry campaign proved</a>, is the absolute number one way to lose an election—remember the ‘I voted for [the bill to appropriate funds for the Iraq war] before I voted against it’ debacle?</p>

<p>“Real” Americans—as Palin and other patriotic pols tell it—don’t change their minds. They are the people of the Constitution’s self-evident truths, the ones enshrined in a document we’ve put under bulletproof glass and for which we have prepared a blast-proof bunker in case of nuclear war. This emphasis on certainty and permanence dovetails nicely with an evangelical Christian attitude—if you hold the Constitution sacred in a way similar to how you revere the Bible (indeed, if you view the former as an outgrowth of the latter), naturally the idea that the Constitution is a document in flux and must be reinterpreted and amended comes as repugnant.</p>

<p>It is therefore easy to impugn people who want to debate and reframe these original concepts; it is easy to distain them for claiming to “know better.” This natural though problematic interpretation of an enthusiasm for public policy as a claim to intellectual superiority is exactly the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/0805073396">mindset the right-wing has exploited</a> in its successful harnessing of so-called elitism to government, and thereby fostering a distain for them both.</p>

<p>Where it matters most, then, Gingrich has been faithful, because it is far more important to be faithful to concepts than it is to people. This is why it is patriotic to propose resolving the deficit crisis on the backs of the poor and middle class—the <em>idea</em> of <em>America</em> being <em>destroyed by debt</em> is far worse than actual poor people whose day-to-day struggles you never see. A deep commitment to principles (again, something abstract) explains why a bunch of old white men can debate the reproductive rights of all women. And why, in the course of that debate, it is okay for Congressman Jon Kyl to state on the floor of the Senate that abortion services account for well over 90% of what Planned Parenthood does, and then later say, in a statement issued from his office, that those words “were not intended to be a factual statement.” How nice, but also how frightening, for Kyl to admit that he knew he was lying! (In fact, abortion constitutes about 3% of Planned Parenthood’s provided services. Oh, and there an existing mandate that no federal funds may finance abortion. Or that the deal that avoided a government shutdown included a provision making it illegal for the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/11/135317751/congresswoman-budget-bears-bad-news-for-nations-capital">District of Columbia</a> to use its own tax revenue for abortion services.)</p>

<p>Both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2011/04/12/135347030/jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-tweak-sen-kyl-on-planned-parenthood">had a field day with this one</a>, and of course we must have laughter between our tears. Sadly, though, Wyatt Cenac (in his satirical correspondent’s report on <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-april-11-2011/countdown-to-the-next-countdown---jon-kyl-lies-about-planned-parenthood">The Daily Show</a>) couldn’t be more descriptive of the current state of political discourse in his use of the term “lie facts” to describe Kyl’s inflammatory, statistical pants-on-fire-claim. Even worse, though, is the fact that to many people the explanation of the ‘ends justifying the means’ offered by Cenac wouldn’t sound ironic at all. “In his defense, he’s only lying about something that he believes in. It’s in service of a strongly-held moral principle.”</p>

  <p>Was really amazing to see Brad squirm under questioning. As soon as the woman took some control, he said “I can’t breathe”. Obviously he is OK only if he can be the total control freak. This show about concurrent polygamy is not authentic. —Comment left by dorianmodeo about <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20043169-10391698.html">the season finale of ABC’s <em>The Bachelor</em>, March 15, 2011</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brad Womack is a reality tv star, famous for his dual appearances on ABC’s <em>The Bachelor</em>. He has appeared twice because the first time around, he famously chose neither of his final two beauties. This time, it seems that his choice of single-mother Emily Maynard, to whom he proposed in the finale, <a href="http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-bachelor/the-bachelor-breakup-are-brad-40054.aspx">is already over</a>. (And I’m afraid that the irony of the phrase “intensely private couple” used by the post’s author, Meghan Carlson, is lost on her.)</p>

<p>This romance reality show falls midway on a spectrum ranging from ‘all show’ to ‘real life’. At the far end of this spectrum (all show), you find programs that take place separate and cut off from daily life. These include reality game shows where the contestants are removed from their normal lives to endure special circumstances, whether for money, fame, personal betterment, or some combination thereof (e.g., <em>Survivor</em>, <em>The Amazing Race</em>, <em>The Biggest Loser</em>). At the other end, we find situations where the cameras are invited in to a pre-existing situation to “follow” the subjects (<em>Jon and Kate plus 8</em>, <em>Real Life Housewives of [Wherever]</em>, <em>16 and Pregnant</em>). Naturally, these subjects remain changed by the shows—Jon and Kate got divorced, and both housewives and teen moms become tabloid targets—but they are only competing against the perniciousness of national attention, rather than other “contestants”.</p>

<p><em>The Bachelor</em> finds itself in the middle of this road in that it is a contestant-based program designed (ostensibly) to create an enduring status quo, namely, a lasting, monogamous relationship. It is not so much a post-modern dating show as a post-modern mating show: it puts a man or woman in the midst of a media-eager harem for the purpose of finding the protagonist a suitable marriage partner.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever seen the show, of course, is acquainted with the obvious hypocrisy, and even idiocy, with which this purported goal is pursued. I am reminded of the brilliant and crass anti-war slogan I saw during a march in the early days of the (second) Iraq war: “Bombing for Peace is like Fucking for Virginity.” <em>The Bachelor</em> uses similarly antithetical tactics to achieve its noble purpose. True love, marriage, and monogamy are planks in its platform, but the campaign consists of contrived adultery: a man (or woman) is supposed to find ‘the one’ by exploring, deepening, and expressing (with words and physical intimacy) these unique feelings for more than one contestant at once.</p>

<p>Anyone who won’t play this game—such a woman waiting for marriage to have sex—doesn’t stand of chance of winning it (as evidenced when Jake Pavelka rejected Corrie Adamson after her confession of her stance on this issue, which included no pre-nuptial co-habitation). The show pretends principles and engages our most moral fantasies of ‘happily ever after,’ but like most game shows, what it needs are players—and in this case, that includes women who are willing to be played. In short, it needs both its contestants and audience to believe in certain ends while suspending disbelief regarding the means to those ends.</p>

<h3 id="insincerity">Insincerity</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You have heard that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.” But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell. It was also said, “Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.” But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of infidelity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. —Matt. 5:27-32</p>

<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discipleship-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Vol/dp/0800683242"><em>Discipleship</em></a> [in German, <em>Nachfolge</em>, literally, coming after], does something rather radical. He makes a serious attempt to take Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount as a real how-to for a Christian life. Bonhoeffer demonstrates an amazing ability not to be dead-ended by the apparent either/or interpretational possibilities. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At this point, must we not decisively face the question of whether or not Jesus intended his command to be taken literally or merely figuratively? … Our own will advises us to flee from this decision, which appears to be so deadly serious. But the question itself is wrong and evil. It cannot be answered. If we were to say that, of course, the command is not meant to be taken literally, then we would already have dodged the seriousness of the command. But if we were to say, of course, it should be taken literally, this would only show that Christian existence is absurd on principle, and the command would lose its authority. It is precisely the fact that, for us, this basic question is not answered that binds us so completed to Jesus’ command. Neither option offers us an escape. —Discipleship, <em>Chapter 6: The Sermon on the Mount</em>, “Woman” (p. 126)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way out that Jesus offers, Bonhoeffer explains, is captured by contrast between the imposition of the law (the Commandments) and the mercy of the gospel. And as the gospel is a gospel of love, Jesus’ words on adultery speak to preservation of the integrity of faith, rather than as a denial of the body and its desires. Bonhoeffer writes: “Jesus does not disapprove of the body and its natural desires. But he rejects the lack of faith that is concealed in it.” Thus at root in the prohibition against adultery is really an admonition against infidelity in a much greater sense, both within and without marriage, both in and out of bed.</p>

<p>As marriage under religion is a union designed to sanctify the connection between two people via their individual unions to God, it becomes a natural synecdoche for an individual’s sincerity, one’s personal faith. Faith can only be understood as a totality, and thus the debate over the location of adultery (or sin in general) in this deed or that word or that thought is just as senseless in this context as the directive to cut off one’s hand or take out one’s eye—indeed, the senseless of the latter reveals Jesus’ lack of interest in a literal interpretation.</p>

<p>Bonhoeffer concludes his book:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The follower [Nachfolger] of Jesus is the imitator [Nachahmer] of God. “Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children” (Eph. 5:1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No image could better express the loving nature of faith, and its emphasis on closeness to God, rather than division. Society has thrown stones or had letters sewn for women who have been “unfaithful,” all the while missing the point that the far greater danger is to be empty of faith. Faith that, like children, we are needy, deserving, and able to love ourselves so that, as the psalm goes, our cups runneth over.</p>
