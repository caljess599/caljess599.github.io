<p>Today, Mississippians are voting on the above amendment to their state constitution. This amendment, which is promoted by its supporters as a way to outlaw abortion and cloning within Mississippi, also carries the potential to cloud many other issues, including the use of birth control methods that function by preventing uterine implantation and the handling of embryos during infertility treatments.</p>

<p>No matter how you feel about the abortion issue, it should be noted that being “pro-life” cannot be readily grafted onto the legal concept of personhood. An awareness of the potential complications, given the numerous mentions of ‘person’ in the state constitution, motivated the Catholic Diocese of Jackson, Miss. <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/mississippi-prepares-to-vote-on-personhood-amendment/">not to take a position on the amendment</a>, despite its support for a definition of human life at conception. The space between a religious understanding of life and a legal understanding of personhood is easily illustrated by the misfortune of miscarriage, which the Church would certainly not view as related to abortion, but which the Mississippi amendment could potentially reframe as manslaughter. While already 38 of the 50 states have fetal homicide laws—intending to protect mother and unborn child from attacks by third parties—there is a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges">growing trend to use these laws to prosecute mothers</a> in cases of miscarriage and stillbirths.</p>

<p>The Mississippi amendment is no doubt partly motivated by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges">the case of Rennie Gibbs</a>, who became pregnant at 15 and whose child was stillborn at 36 weeks. Once it was discovered that Ms. Gibbs was a cocaine user, she was charged with “depraved-heart murder” of her child, a crime that carries a mandatory life sentence. Defense lawyers, however, pointed out that according to Mississippi law, even if Ms. Gibbs had intended to harm her fetus, she couldn’t be prosecuted, as <em>it was not illegal for a mother to try to cause an abortion</em>. (It is illegal, however, for a third party to attempt to cause an (unwanted) abortion.) As repugnant as this may sound to many ears, it would be rather non-sensical from a legal point of view if it were licit for a woman to seek an abortion but not to perform one on herself. Amendment 26 would of course change this, for it would give the mother and fetus equivalent legal standing.</p>

<p>While I remain pro-choice, I remain so on legal grounds rather than philosophical ones. Philosophically, I don’t need to be convinced that life starts at conception—for a woman intending to have a baby, there is no doubt that she understands what is inside her as life as soon as the tests confirm she is pregnant. Indeed, this appreciation is often pushed back even further in time for women who become pregnant from artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization—how could they not understand their child’s life as beginning at that moment?</p>

<p>In the case of an unwanted pregnancy, however, a woman’s attitude may change. The question thus arises: but if it is a life when you do want it, how can it not be a life when you don’t want it? This is the uncomfortable fact at the root of the abortion debate. The pro-life camp might say “that life has a right to live;” the pro-choice camp might say “a woman has a right to control her own body”. Neither of these arguments, I would suggest, get at the root of the issue, as both sacrifice principles to practice. In reality, neither that unborn life nor that living body is truly independent in the ways that these two sides of the debate would suggest. On the one hand, the fetus lives literally inside the mother, and thus its right to life cannot be considered separate of her; on the other, the woman’s body itself is contingent on a wealth of internal and external factors out of anyone’s control. Within this material world, there is no such thing as <em>an idea of life</em>, there is only its manifestation.</p>

<p>The Occupy Movement has, among other things, stirred up a fair amount of anti-corporation sentiment. For many people on the left, the source of the problematic power possessed by corporations lies in the fact that they constitute legal “persons,” and are thus entitled to many constitutional protections extended to actual people.</p>

<p>Strangely, the coming-into-personhood of the corporation is related to the ending of the institution of slavery in America, for it was the Supreme Court’s extension of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to corporations that allowed them to assume the rights of personhood. Stranger still, the Court <a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=43811311612&amp;topic=12012">never really decided this issue</a> so much as took it for granted that the amendment applied to corporations; the Chief Justice simply stated the Court’s belief in an unrelated remark during the oral arguments of <em>Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad</em>, 118 U.S. 394 (1886), a case that was unrelated to the notion of corporate personhood.</p>

<p>Yet the assumption was far-reaching, as the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment—meant originally to protect freed slaves!—allowed them to escape regulation and grow powerful. “Between 1890 and 1910,” Joel Bakan notes in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corporation-Pathological-Pursuit-Profit-Power/dp/0743247469/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320767240&amp;sr=1-1">The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power</a> “business interests invoked the Fourteenth Amendment 288 times before the courts, compared to 19 times by African Americans, according to Mary Zepernick of the Program on Corporations, Law and Democracy in an interview” (172).</p>

<p>While corporations are subject to greater regulation now than in the hey-day of the robber barons (FDR’s threat to pack the court in 1937 convinced the justices not to block his New Deal), corporations’ status as persons still gives them disproportional power. The controversial <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/"><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em></a> decision, in which the Supreme Court held that political spending is a form of protected speech, now allows corporations (and other groups, such as unions) to spend unlimited money in support of political issues and candidates.</p>

<p>In this context, free means unfettered, but it would be hard to believe that this type of “free speech,” i.e., corporations “speaking” through money, is supportive of a healthy democracy, in which context this fundamental right is usually invoked. This evolution toward a cynical interpretation of the Constitution seems to result in a kind of rhetorical malaise, in which politicians can grind out the same ol’ wonderful phrases of “an American Century” and exhort us to “believe in America,” as Mitt Romney put it in his <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/10/07/text-of-mitt-romneys-speech-on-foreign-policy-at-the-citadel/">foreign policy speech</a> delivered at the Citadel in South Carolina on 7 October 2011, without capturing the heart or imagination of the American electorate.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65857.html">Romney’s Mormonism</a> may explain some of the difficulty he has had gaining popular support for his presidential bid—despite the tacit assumption that, as the establishment candidate, he’ll surely get the nod—I would suggest that the obvious strain of such Reagan-era rhetoric also contributes to his lack of appeal. While it has become patriotic in certain circles to aspire to defend “liberty” in the form of deregulation and “the pursuit of happiness” in the form of lower taxes, these empty promises of prosperity seems less and less correlated to reality. So we take refuge in the fundamental goodness and innocence of “life” in the form of an embryo, and go vote to give full legal rights to the unborn as the poverty rate (among the already-born) rises and millions of (already-grown) Americans are unemployed.</p>

<p>We seem unable to grapple with the unprincipled problems of children in poverty, jobs exported overseas, and healthcare costs rising as surely as the earth’s oceans. Romney is reasonably qualified to be president – he certainly made some positive changes in Massachusetts as Governor, despite now decrying “Obamacare”. Listening to Romney remark that “corporations are people” in reply to hecklers at the Iowa State Fair (watch the clip as part of <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/394519/august-11-2011/romney-2012----corporations-are-people-">Steven Colbert’s brilliant send-up of it</a>), you get the impression that the rhetoric has gone to his head, that he actually has more faith in the purity of clichés than in the fact that he helped bring about near-universal healthcare coverage in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>While I have no doubt that Herman Cain has no capacity, and even less genuine desire, to take on these issues as President, I can see why he is so amusing as a candidate. Even though I can see right through Cain’s faux-populism (can you imagine paying a 9% federal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States#Summary_table">sales tax on <em>food</em></a>?), I can’t bear to hear Romney’s platitudes. Uninformed and pompous as he is, Herman Cain is more believable as a person than the clean-cut capitalist; even if he is a pants-on-fire liar about 9-9-9 being fair, at least his claims are not the same ones that have been repeated <em>ad nauseam</em>—and proven ridiculous—by a long line of suits.</p>

<p>So what if he’s a serial sexual harasser of women? Everyone knows that some embryos grow up to be jerks.</p>
