<p>December marks the end of the regular season of college football, which means the time when the heads of losing coaches start to roll, often rolling in dough as the result of generous severance (pardon the pun) packages. <!--more--> While no school likes to have a losing team, especially when that losingness persists for several years on end, it is obviously impossible that every team should have a winning season–someone needs to lose for someone to win. This fact can be reacted to in two ways. On the one hand, this is an argument for why college athletic programs need to toss out losing coaches like (expensive) used tissues: if someone has to lose, I’d rather it not be me. On the other hand, however, one could arrive at the opposite conclusion: if in a system where everyone is trying to win, yet losing still happens as often as winning, perhaps which coach it happens under is beside the point. The difference in these two conclusions is one of expectations: the person with the first attitude believes that even in a system where someone must lose, his team does not have to be the loser. The second person is less optimistic about his abilities to influence a system into which the inevitability of uneven results has been built in.</p>

<p>The ability to form expectations must rank among higher-level mental tasks, as they are abstract and idiosyncratic. Being based on hope rather than purely on reason, we can expect a football coach to win more games than he loses, even though we know that someone must lose–and even when we have seen our team lose over and over.</p>

<p>In this way, expectations are much looser than–and often uninformed by–the ratiocination of our faculty of judgment. A timely example: we can be told it is going to snow, and snow a lot, but when this is not a frequent occurrence, until the snow starts to fall and the road conditions start to worsen, the reality of the storm doesn’t sink in… it wasn’t what we expected, even though we were told to expect it. And thus more than curiosity or stupidity, it is the wily nature of expectations that leads to dozens of people stuck in their cars out on the road and dozens more cars stuck in the snow and abandoned. Really, you cannot expect a snowstorm until you’re already in it. Unless, perhaps, you’re a meteorologist?</p>
