<p>As a friend of mind recently said, “Never is just tomorrow’s lunch.” For those who thought that K-12 public school teaching would forever remain a generally ignored profession in this country, lunch is now on the table. While long relegated to the classic ‘women’s career’ trifecta of nurse-secretary-teacher, it seems that suddenly everyone has woken up extremely concerned that many of the molders of America’s young minds are not up to snuff. Unfortunately, this concern about attracting the best and brightest to the field of education has not led to a rapid rise in teacher salaries (as it has done for the <a href="http://www.epi.org/economic_snapshots/entry/webfeatures_snapshots_20060627/" target="_blank">skyrocketing compensation of American CEOs in recent decades</a>). Rather, it has led to a rather shocking public scapegoating in which the ineffective teacher is maligned as a malevolent succubus on the body public (school).</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The (lost) battle in Wisconsin over the right of state employees to collectively bargain is in one way the continuation of this larger and longer discussion about the quality of public education in this country. For many years now – certainly since the passage of George Bush 43’s “No Child Left Behind” bill in 2001 – many critics of the status quo have advocated that the most effective way to improve the quality of public education is to identify effective and ineffective teachers, rewarding the former while eliminating the latter. In order to do this, the long-standing (union) policies that provide job security for many public school teachers need to be altered or done away with entirely.</p>

<p>At first blush, this kind of performance- and incentive-based scheme seems like a wonderful idea. (Never mind the fact that extremely high-paid finance industry folks brought down the economy three years ago!) Almost everyone can recall the benefits she received from a particularly caring or talented teacher. In some cases, our early teachers inspire in us a love for a subject that becomes a life’s work (whether remunerated or not).</p>

<p>The problem with this concept is where one might expect it – in the details. What does it mean for a teacher to be effective, and how exactly do you measure it?</p>

<p>In the realm of K-12 education, standardized testing, which has been for ages the standard yardstick of student performance (or of learning, if you will), is now being recast as the measure of teacher performance (or of teaching effectiveness). This shift has prompted teachers to “teach to the test” – meaning, to teach not in a way they think is best, but in a way that can demonstrate (immediately) that they are effective. Thus the incentive of curricular autonomy, of using one’s own judgment, has been replaced by the disincentive of losing one’s job if the kids don’t make the grade.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, good teaching does not always lead to learning in the case of each individual student, not only in general, but specifically as measured on a standardized test taken in a specific moment in time. This is because there are many variables that effect student learning, from innate intelligence, personal interest and motivation, home environment, and – though we rarely talk about it – the professional chemistry between student and teacher. (And no I did not get <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/opinion/08brooks.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=homepage" target="_blank">this idea from David Brooks</a> – I’m just generally cursed with thinking the same thing at the same time someone much more famous is thinking it.) Not to mention the often cavalier attitude of students toward standardized tests. I recall having to retake some state exam by myself, because I had been absent the day it was given, and I got so bored at the end that I just filled in bubbles at random so I could go to lunch.</p>

<p>To return to my argument, we have all had teachers whom we loved, as well as those we have… well, not loved. Every student and every teacher is unique, and there is no way to ensure that every student will always have the most well-matched teacher for her learning style or personal preference. As in cooking, the best ingredients and recipe don’t always ensure a tasty dinner. This is just the entropy and unpredictability of what we call real life.</p>
<h3>Popularity</h3>
<p>In the realms of higher education,  professor performance is being increasingly determined by student evaluations – both official and unofficial. On an official level, the surveys that students fill out at the end of a term about the course and their professor are being given more and more weight in hiring, firing, and (supposedly) tenure decisions. Similar to the backlash against unionized K-12 teachers who keep their jobs (or their pay) even after being labeled ineffective or worse (see this <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/31/090831fa_fact_brill?yrail" target="_blank">stunning article in <em>The New Yorker</em></a> about the termination process in New York City), recently there has been an outcry against elite (read: liberal), tenured professors who are paid a great deal of money to do very little teaching, and not necessarily any of it well or with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>While the experience of a course with such a professor is inarguably demoralizing – and anyone who has taken a Bachelor’s degree at a major research university has almost certainly had this experience (ah, Apuleius!) – the transformation of the University into University, Inc. (meaning, from an institution of higher learning to a service industry of diploma issuance) has not been all roses and butterflies. Indeed, arguably it has hardly impacted the targets of the main outcry, as there is no indication that established, valuable professors (meaning those who are famous, or who bring in money, or both) are being denied tenure or fired because of low evaluations.</p>

<p>Instead, universities are cutting way back on tenure regardless of its relation to teaching effectiveness, something they can afford to do given the superabundance of PhDs in the current job market. Thus the brunt of the reward-for-performance emphasis on teaching is falling onto those least shielded by the institutional protections of long-term contracts and tenure. (The latest <a href="http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/survey_coalition/repview_coalition" target="_blank">Survey by the Coalition on the Academic Workforce</a> reports that “full-time tenure-track faculty members taught less than half of the introductory undergraduate courses in all but two of the disciplines” surveyed. <a href="http://www.mla.org/files/coalition_table2.htm" target="_blank">See table</a>.) While elite institutions may be selling students on the institution’s responsiveness to their evaluations, the bottom line that usually counts is not who is best, but who is cheapest.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the increasing availability of instructor evaluations to all students at a given university has turned course selection into a popularity contest. While there is some truth to the expression “forewarned is forearmed,” there are arguably some distinct disadvantages to letting the previous experience of other students influence your choice on whether to take a certain course. For one, <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/deep-in-the-heart-of-texas/?src=me&amp;ref=general" target="_blank">as Stanley Fish has argued</a>, students may not be in the best position to evaluate a teacher or course’s effectiveness at the end of a term – or even by the end of college. Second, there is simply no accounting for taste. <em>De gustibus non est disputandum</em>. Third, there is a learning curve in teaching, and this goes double for teachers who are just starting their post-graduate teaching careers. With fewer and fewer recent PhDs finding a long-term or tenure track position upon graduation, it becomes increasingly difficult to gather momentum – including stunning evaluations – that may be necessary for a continuing career.</p>

<p>The consideration of other people’s opinions – and the tendency to treat them as predictive of one’s own experience – is the devil in the detailed-data world in which we now live. While the millenials will have to take our word on this, the rest of us who used to read (literally) the newspaper can tell you that it is an entirely different experience from reading the same content online. Years ago now, I remarked with chagrin that my experience of my preferred daily, the <em>New York Times</em>, had deteriorated significantly now that I rarely read the print edition. And why was this? Because with the physical paper I scanned the pages for articles that caught my interest, whereas on the website, I usually just scrolled down the list of the most popular articles and read a smattering of those. <em>And even though I knew that this was impoverishing my experience</em> (a number of times my mother, who reads the print edition faithfully, would point out an article of interest that I hadn’t noticed), I rarely bothered (except on Sundays) to browse the website in the way I did the paper version.</p>

<p>For better and for worse, it comes as second nature to today’s students to share their opinions, usually in the moment they have them. Where they get their information – the Internet – is also the forum that encourages them to add their own. It requires hardly any effort to “like” something on Facebook or write a comment on a newspaper story or blog. On screen, somehow, the text of the article seems equal to all other texts; the original context (the newspaper itself) has vanished, and along with it, an important reminded of the methods of its production, especially the generous ratio of time, thought, and research expended per word written that is the hallmark of good journalism.</p>

<p>Similarly, buttressed by the safety of anonymity and tempted by the all-to-human urge to gossip, students are now drawn to look at and contribute to websites that allow anyone to comment on a professor’s competence, style, and of course, looks. In this appearance-obsessed and comment-driven culture, what (and who) is liked in the academy becomes what is highly rated. This is unfortunate for every professor who, by unfamiliarity with the student body, temperament, teaching style, looks, or what have you, is not immediately likable – and immediately is the key term here, because nowadays it is first reactions, and not reflections that matter.</p>

<p>We see this everyday in the blogosphere, which then tends to influence the (formerly?) mainstream media. A prime recent example is the video made of NPR fund-raiser Ron Schiller at the initiative of political activist James O’Keefe that led to Schiller’s hastened departure (he had already announced he was leaving) from NPR. The<a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/03/14/134525412/Segments-Of-NPR-Gotcha-Video-Taken-Out-Of-Context" target="_blank"> follow-up coverage</a> (including viewing and analysis of the raw video footage of the two-hour lunch between Schiller and the two men posing as representatives of a Muslim organization) revealed, however, that Schiller had done an excellent job of explaining that no donor to NPR could buy coverage, given the firewall that existed between development and the newsroom. Nevertheless, the mere suggestion of any impropriety was enough to prompt not only Ron Schiller’s hastened departure and his reneging on his next post at the Aspen Institute but also the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/03/10/134388981/npr-ceo-vivian-schiller-resigns" target="_blank">resignation of the CEO of NPR, Vivienne Schiller</a> (no relation).</p>

<p>While arguably these resignations were pragmatic – given the intense scrutiny of NPR by Republicans who are somehow convinced that any media organization that receives government funding must be a bastion of socialist thought – they were not logical. Nor do they stand in the long term to benefit either NPR or the general media culture. Our notions of what constitutes honesty and disclosure have become distorted if we are ready to believe that two posers hired by a man with no commitment to journalistic objectivity can spend two hours misrepresenting themselves and somehow expose – via a heavily and deliberately edited videotape of events – the â€˜hypocrisy’ of Ron Schiller. This situation suggests that the roles of appearance and reality have undergone a radical reversal in our culture. He who misrepresents himself for a â€˜cause’ is the truth-bearer, while he who speaks honestly (though not perfectly), in the assumption of privacy, is a hypocrite. Context is powerless against the pernicious temptation to take everything at face value – and how else do we have time to take anything, if we are bombarded by media rocket fire 24/7?</p>
<h3>Complaint Culture</h3>
<p>Essentially, the problem with telling someone over and over that her opinion matters (What’s on your mind? asks the mindless Facebook) is that she may eventually forget that opinions are better off carefully weighed, and perhaps not voiced at all in certain contexts. (Glenn Beck is a really good example of someone who <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-03-14/news/29147017_1_glenn-beck-natural-disasters-health-care-bill#ixzz1GcmjUU9H" target="_blank">just can’t help himself</a>, and who has been keenly rewarded for his blowhardery with fame and fortune.)</p>

<p>In the realm of education, complaint culture has many potential dangers. Unjustified student griping via evaluations may unfairly lead to the dismissal of a good teacher, but so can the <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/facebook_vent_burns_teacher_JiHBB6wQwDljiYVfcUiIpN#ixzz1GXquxvdS" target="_blank">unfortunate expression of a teacher’s frustrations lead to her firing</a>. Reading this rather shocking example of this Facebook episode, one is prompted to roll one’s eyes and wonder how this teacher could have been so careless as to post something so inflammatory in a (for all purposes, if not intents) public forum. However, we should not kid ourselves that students (or rather, the clients) at University (Inc.) are acting with any greater level of reflection – as they are more insulated by their status as â€˜paying customers’, if anything, they are acting with less.</p>

<p>Of course it is unpleasant that Ms. Rubino put into unfortunate words her frustrations about her fifth graders. But such frustrations aren’t new; Facebook didn’t create them, it just made them public. What Facebook does do is put us face to face with them, and so we suddenly feel that we have to “do” something about the situation – even if logically we know that Ms. Rubino’s having felt (or even expressed) that emotion does not make her (objectively) a worse teacher. Similarly, students have always disliked some of their courses and their professors. They just haven’t always been empowered with the notion that their dislike entitles them to pass judgment on that professor’s retention.</p>

<p>This notion that we must be always and immediately satisfied in our culture seems to be leading to the ever-quickening pace of judgment, but all this judgment – or rather venting – seems to be impoverishing the public sphere rather than enriching it. It is true that you have a right to your opinion, and free speech is great. But just as often, the profligate expression of our thoughts comes at a price.</p>
