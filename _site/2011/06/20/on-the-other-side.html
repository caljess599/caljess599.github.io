        <h3>Chance of rain</h3>
<p>I meant to write this while I was still west, rather than east; that is, on the other side of the country. Though that side is the side I was originally on, it has become by now the other side, even though the word home applies, in different ways, to each. I can always ‘go home’ out west, but I ‘am home’ when I am east. I no longer even resent or resist the sticky summer heat; I take my generic Zyrtec and consent to sweating like a pig as I mow my weed lawn in the beating noontime, because I wasn’t up during the smart morning hours, and by afternoon there is a chance of rain. Which I learn today is not some weatherman’s bet, but rather the statistic that on 40 out of 100 days with these same conditions, it has indeed rained.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>There are many things I could do, but mowing is one I must do, and I am grateful to have the energy to begin. Knowing I will be exhausted by the end of it, I could never find the willingness to begin without a minimal threshold of well-being. Indeed, afterward, I am peeling clothes off myself, depositing them in the washing machine and myself in the shower. I sit for a while with an ice pack on the back of my neck.</p>

<p>There is a joy to completing the labor our commitments ask of us, a satisfaction that is distinct from, but complementary to, the joy of leisure. Out west, I had some time to do a little nothing in particular… I took a trip to see a friend in Eugene, OR, and we drove around to see various places, like old covered bridges, the dunes and the ocean, the Cascades region, nearby towns. In Corvallis, we tasted wine near the park by the Willamette river as the town’s high schoolers gathered in their various interpretations of formal wear and took (and had taken) photos – it was the promenade part put back into the right of passage known as prom.</p>
<h3>Prom(ises) and lies</h3>
<p>The revelers are, and all look young, with impossibly firm bodies and evenly-colored skin, on display by many a girl’s backless dress. I don’t feel bad not thinking of them as “women”. They look to me as my classmates did over 15 years ago. They are beautiful, surely, but now I know how hard it is to be young, and I feel a vague sympathy for them. You couldn’t pay me to repeat those years. It is without nostalgia that, back in California, I toss out the pattern I used to make my boyfriend’s matching cummerbund and bow-tie – that matched, of course, my prom dress, which I also made. I believe that these articles themselves have long since met the dustbin.</p>

<p>It is almost shocking how little nostalgia I have for the past, how delicious it is to lower my sentimental footprint by getting rid of books I know I won’t read (again or ever), papers from the eons of my education, random bric-a-brac of years past. Instead I thrill to the changing of the guard, the reinvention of the old and the transition into the new. My mother and I come across the prom pattern while we are combining the contents of the separate sewing baskets that we’ve kept, hers from forever, mine from I guess the double digits of childhood.</p>
<h3>A stitch in time</h3>
<p>Finally she’s given up on her round basket that has long since started to fray at the top, and in a reversal of tradition, she agrees to inherit mine. So we carefully go through everything, condensing and sorting in preparation for consolidation. I feel an odd sense of victory that now my basket, which is admittedly ugly, is going to be ‘the basket,’ home of ‘the sewing scissors,’ and I ceremoniously position all the tokens of my childhood to which the old basket has long been home… a round photo of me at 4 or so made into an ornament (a sewing basket being as good a Jewish alternative to a Christmas tree as any), the snap applicator with its double set of light blue jaws that used to entertain me as a child, even though I have no memories of wearing the baby clothes my mother made with it. I delight in redefining our tomato pin cushions to work in concert, making one pins, the other needles, and twirling their strawberry ends together. I untangle and wind the most random colors of thread.</p>

<p>I tease my mom constantly about her nostalgia, her instinct for preservation of my childhood, knowing all the while that it is a bit unfair, like teasing someone who has a cold for sniffling. I am (as yet) childless, and therefore still immune from that particular affliction that I imagine is quite powerful, and reasonably so. Indeed, I am watching it happen with my newborn “nephew,” (actually my first cousin’s son, but I’m going to bribe him to call me aunt). I go with her and little Aidan to Guest Services at the Giant’s game to have a first-game certificate printed out. It comes with a great photo flyer celebrating the Giants 2010 victory in the World Series. One wonders how old he’ll be when they win again, and if he will inherit his parents’ passion for the team, carefully nurtured from 8,000 miles away in London. I wonder how he will feel as, years from now, he reflects as a boy or young man upon his baby book and tries to conjure an event the rest of us remember, but that he can only imagine himself into.</p>
<h3>Country roads</h3>
<p>A friend is a good destination to lure me out into the country, a friend and a walk. My enjoyment of a pretty drive in the country is the exact inverse of my loathing of lengthy commutes, and I am charmed by the fact that the river trail we proceed to for an afternoon hike is actually familiar to me – I have been there once before, nearly a year previous, under much different circumstances. There is a unique pleasure to the unexpectedly familiar, and also to the fulfillment of simple pleasures prompted merely by circumstance, like a quick dip in a cool mountain water hole in a miraculous five minutes of privacy before the next cluster of hikers. Floating in the clear chill, face to the air and eyes to the sky, I am gleefully free of inhibition and its related sufferings.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, I stay for dinner at my friend’s landlord’s house, enjoying a great meal and a sweet celebration of Father’s Day. After dessert, I remember to call my grandfather to send my best wishes, and he complements me on the <a title="A Christmas Mitzvah" href="http://www.lightthetunnel.net/?p=35">post I wrote about my great-aunt</a>, which I had enclosed in print copy in his card at my grandmother’s request. Maybe it is just the effects of a delicious day of leisure, exercise, and food, the generosity of strangers, and the charm of two well-mannered sons, but somehow when my grandfather tells me I have a way with words, I feel that my long-time dream of writing will come to fruition, someday, somehow… because there is a simple goodness about the idea.</p>

<p>On the way home, in the grey light of a fading cloudy day, I come to a stop on a narrow road – there is a cow on it, big, hulking, slow, and quite obviously out of place. I cannot not do something, even after it crosses the road and I can drive on. I don’t know why this is… because I love cows, even if they belong to the country and me to the city? Because they are valuable animals, and thus constitute someone’s livelihood? I can’t say. I pull over into a nearby driveway, and signal to a woman across a field, who signals to her husband, who – after a scary encounter between one tiny unleashed dog and a jittery hulking bovine (what I am worried about? my car? me inside? the cow?) – manages to usher it across the road, back towards is probable provenance. Then I can go. Home.</p>
