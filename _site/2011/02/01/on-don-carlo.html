<p>In tragic opera, when you fall in love, it is forever. There will be no getting over it, no moving on, and no satisfaction, either. Therefore the only possible rival–or alternative–to such love is a higher principle or virtue.</p>

<p>In the case of the star-crossed lovers Don Carlo and his lovely Elisabetta–his once-bethrothed who ends up his mother (the Church doesn’t really acknowledge a “step” relationship the way we might) when his father, King Filippo, takes the French princess for himself–their respective higher principles are that of piety and liberty, or, abstractly put, the ying-yang virtues of bondage and freedom.</p>

<p>Having been asked to assent to the marriage in order to bring peace to her people (ending the war between France and Spain), Elisabetta feels it is her duty to accept as the will of God her role as Queen of Spain and mother to the man she loves in a non-filial way. Heartsick and homesick, she nonetheless remains dutiful and pious; although she does not love her husband, she refuses to sully her own name, or his, with the stain of adultery. (As it turns out, it is the King himself who strays, seducing the beautiful Princess Eboli, who out of jealousy of Carlo’s love for Elisabetta, accuses her of infidelity.)</p>

<p>For Carlo, it is his best friend the Marquis (and later Duke) di Posa, Rodrigo, who fans the flames of his long-standing commitment to the cause of liberty, specifically that of the Flemish people, who are currently being oppressed by Spanish rule. Even when Rodrigo becomes the King’s main counselor, he never wavers in his love for his brother-in-arms Carlo, and he dies in his place by taking from him compromising papers of Carlo’s involvement in the Flemish rebellion.</p>

<p>The brilliance of Verdi’s opera is its exploration of the crumbling of the very foundations of these apparently stark and solid principles. References to God, heaven, the vanities of the world and the peaceful repose of death abound, and even the lightest of directorial touches cannot help but hammer home the contraction between devotion to a loving, merciful God, the peace of heaven and the human cruelties of the Inquisition. If the general context of celebration, complete with royal appearance, as heretics are led to burn at the stake in an auto-da-fÃ© weren’t symbolic enough, the elderly and stern Grand Inquisitor himself is blind.</p>

<p>Filippo himself is pained by the inadequacies of his power as sovereign. Estranged from his son for both political and emotional reasons, and saddened by the awareness that his wife never loved him, the only consolation he finds is in the loyalty of his confidant Rodrigo, who for one is not truly his, dying in the end in place of Carlo and their cause of Flemish liberty, and whom the Inquisitor scorns when he visits Filippo, asking him why he is called King if there is a man equal to him. This in the same scene in which the King asks if he will be forgiven if he signs the death warrant on his own son. (The justification the Inquisitor gives when Filippo asks whether, as a Christian, he can kill his son, is that God sacrificed his Son, too, an answer that satisfies neither Filippo nor the audience, who in the auto-da-fÃ© has seen Christ’s suffering equated to the burning of heretics.) Simply put, neither Church nor Crown are happy institutions in this opera, begging the question exactly for what everyone’s duty and obeisance are good for, if the King is lonely and the Inquisitor is blind to the love supposedly at the heart of the religion he serves.</p>

<p>In their final hour alone, Elisabetta convinces Carlo not to let his broken heart destroy him, but to go, as he promised Rodrigo, to lead the Flemish to freedom. They bid their adieus as mother and son, promising to meet again in Heaven. But it is the dull mystery of unheroic death that steals the opera’s final scene: the Inquisitor’s guards slay the prince, and the monk of the cloister, who all recognize by his voice as the ghost of Carlo V, Filippo’s father and Carlo’s grandfather (and namesake), appears to announce, for the final time, that the true war is in the human heart, and is only calmed by death. (N.B. The libretto calls for the Monk to drag Carlo’s body into the tomb, but the recent (2010-11 season) Met staging let the curtain fall with him dead in Elizabetta’s arms.)</p>

<p>For the modern watcher, and even for that of Verdi’s day, the accusations of cruelty and heartlessness, of misguidedness and inadequacy, toward the Spanish Church and the Crown are hardly shocking. Our distance gives us not greater wisdom, merely more evidence with which we can confirm that the perils of violence and misgovernment are hardly limited to the Inquisition and the institution of monarchy. This added perspective of time does not lessen the level of feeling, or the impact of this tragic work. Indeed, it provokes us to wonder what principles and institutions of our current era later artists will enshrine in stage and song, shaking their head at our own faults and blindness.</p>
