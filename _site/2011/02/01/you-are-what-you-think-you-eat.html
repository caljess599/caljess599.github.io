  <p>Yes, some people actually think I’m saying, “Eat whatever you want, whenever you want.” That is not what I’m saying at all. I’m saying: “Look; pay attention.” Most people have hardly enjoyed a meal in their life. There’s no joy or pleasure in food for them, because there’s so much “I should, I shouldn’t, I can’t, I’m going to feel guilty about it afterward.” I teach them how to slow down. I’m basically saying, “We have a choice: we can taste what is in our mouth and utterly enjoy ourselves, or we can remain unconscious of it and be in pain.” People don’t know there is a choice. It doesn’t occur to them that they can actually enjoy eating. Giving them a piece of chocolate is a way to introduce them to pleasure and awareness. At my workshops, there’s an exercise in which we practice savoring a single chocolate kiss. Once, a man told me that he’d been bingeing on chocolate kisses for twenty years and had never eaten just one. The one in his mouth was always the precursor to the ten that came after it, and the two bags after that. But when he actually allowed himself to have one, and was present while eating it, he didn’t want another one. “It’s when I feel I can’t have one,” he said, “that I want twenty.” In a normal dieting mentality, giving that man chocolate would be like handing an ax to an ax murderer. “I’m supposed to eat chocolate?” people say. “But I’m already forty pounds overweight.” Yes, and you’re forty pounds overweight in part because you’re not allowing yourself to have what you’re having anyway, and you’re not paying attention while you’re having it. I am asking people to stop, just for a moment, and think: Have I ever enjoyed chocolate, really? Do I know how to enjoy food? Does it bring me pleasure? I know I’m bingeing all the time, but am I paying attention to even one thing I’m eating? The answer is no. So I am saying: “Show up, not just for meals, but for your life. Taste the food. Sit down. Focus on what you’re doing.” What’s the point of eating chocolate if you’re not going to have a fabulous time doing it? You’re missing your whole life, because you never let yourself have it.</p>

<p>Many years ago, I recall reading an article, I believe in the <em>New York Times Sunday Magazine</em>, about a woman who used her faith to prevent her from eating too much, i.e., Jesus gave her permission, through his provision of abundance, to leave food on her plate. I cannot for the life of me, or the love of Google, find this article. But I did find <a href="http://www.geneenroth.com/">Geneen Roth</a>, who, as you see above, writes about <em>Women, Food and God</em>.</p>

<p>Apparently eating is in our heads as much as our stomachs: if you imagine eating a food, you can satiate your desire for it. Or so says some new research. (This is the scientific version of your mother telling you that when she worked in the ice cream parlor that summer, she stopped eating ice cream…)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The consumption of a food typically leads to a decrease in its subsequent intake through habituation—a decrease in one’s responsiveness to the food and motivation to obtain it. We demonstrated that habituation to a food item can occur even when its consumption is merely imagined. Five experiments showed that people who repeatedly imagined eating a food (such as cheese) many times subsequently consumed less of the imagined food than did people who repeatedly imagined eating that food fewer times, imagined eating a different food (such as candy), or did not imagine eating a food. They did so because they desired to eat it less, not because they considered it less palatable. These results suggest that mental representation alone can engender habituation to a stimulus.</p>

<p>Eating right is hard. So hard, apparently, that the <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/">Center for Science in the Public Interest</a> has brought a class action suit against McDonald’s seeking to restrict the lure of its Happy Meal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A mother of two from Sacramento, Calif., says that McDonald’s uses toys as bait to induce her kids to clamor to go to McDonald’s and to develop a preference for nutritionally poor Happy Meals. With the help of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, today the mom, Monet Parham, is filing a <a href="http://cspinet.org/new/pdf/mcdonald_scomplaint.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> aimed at stopping McDonald’s use of toys to market directly to young children. The suit will be filed in California Superior Court in San Francisco shortly after the court opens for business Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>According to Parham, the main reason her six-year-old daughter, Maya, asks to go to McDonald’s is to get toys based on Barbie, i-Carly, Shrek, or Strawberry Shortcake. The food seems almost beside the point to the kids, says Parham, because the toy monopolizes the attention of Maya and her two-year-old sister Lauryn.</p>
