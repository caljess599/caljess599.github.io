        <p>Have you ever paused to consider the ways and means of human emotions, the contours of the banks in whose beds they run, ever meandering and flowing? Lately I have found myself wondering about the meaning of repugnance, an emotion we all feel, even if we don’t confess to it openly, or even to ourselves.<!--more-->Repugnance, in its purest form, is a several times removed from hatred, or fear, two emotions whose ancestral roots are in ignorance. Repugnance is more visceral, prompted by the conviction of intimacy rather than the prejudice of otherness. Often what repulses us does so, I think, because it is close to us in some way, either by belief or by experience – and in some cases the former can be so strong as to override the absence of the latter.</p>

<p>An example. I am pro-choice: I believe that each woman has the right to control her reproductivity, including through the use of abortion to terminate unwanted pregnancies. This does not mean, however, that I don’t find the use of abortion as casual birth control to be repugnant. Recently, <em>The New York Times</em> reported on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/nyregion/04abortion.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2" target="_blank">very high rate of abortion in New York City</a>. The reporter spoke to a young woman at Planned Parenthood’s Margaret Sanger Center in Greenwich Village.</p>
<blockquote>A 17-year-old girl there to pick up a friend said she had had an abortion in May. It was her second; the first was when she was 15. The girl said she sometimes used condoms. "But I wasn't using them when I got pregnant," she said. "I might use them more now, but I don't know."</blockquote>
<p>Even as a die-hard liberal, I find her attitude sad and offensive. This is an understandable reason why people want to outlaw abortion, because of young women who take unwanted pregnancies so cavalierly and treat abortion as a causal form of birth control, a practical alternative to condom use. I find this view repugnant; it is immature, irresponsible, and wasteful (of time, human resources, and money). Not to mention the fact that I find it difficult to understand why any woman would want to go through the physical trauma of pregnancy termination willy-nilly.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding women like these, I believe the right and access to abortion should remain open, and, for women of limited means, free. (Birth control should be free, too, of course.) Abortion must be legally and easily available simply because there are too many other women, and too many other reasons, why women – including responsible women who have children or want to have a(nother) child – seek to end pregnancies. It is simplistic to reduce all abortions to a callous disregard for human life, or a (selfish) unwillingness to be a parent. The casting of abortion as a moral crime with no gray zone is a prime example of belief overcoming experience in the generation of repugnance. Belief often has the convenience of simplicity, but experience is always more complex.</p>

<p>It is a democratic principle that one must allow people to do things that one finds disagreeable, offensive, and even extremely morally repugnant. This is the meaning of the motto ‘live and let live’. It doesn’t say, ‘live and let live the way I think is right’. While the Republicans may not want to introduce Sharia law, they resemble those radical Islamists in their desire to impose their moral values on everyone else – and the ease with which they justify this desire through recourse to the divine origin of their moral codes.</p>

<p>It is quite contradictory that many on the right wing of the political spectrum – the side that claims to espouse personal liberty – also seem to forget that personal liberty is not equivalent to the freedom to act in the way they deem appropriate. ‘Don’t tread on me’ indeed, says the Tea Party, but they do not advocate for gay marriage or a positive right to abortion.</p>

<p>Non-libertarian conservatives (including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/us/politics/13tea.html" target="_blank">some but not all Tea Partiers</a>) have confused the politics of personal liberty with the politics of repugnance, when the former requires precisely the willing tolerance of what one finds repugnant. Thomas Jefferson, who acted on behalf of Virginia’s Baptists in 1776 to defend their right to practice their religion, admitted his disagreement with their beliefs. Stephen Marini, Historian of Religion, Wellesley College, puts it this way in Part Two of PBS’s fascinating series <a href="http://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/transcripts/hour-two.html" target="_blank">God in America</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Jefferson says, "I couldn't disagree with you more about the substance of all of this. But I will defend your right to say it." And that's exactly what he does.</blockquote>
<p>Jefferson (who edited his own Bible – talk about take what you like and leave the rest!) understood that the issue was not one of moral approval, but of legal permission, and he was willing to fight for someone else’s right to do something with which he disagreed.</p>

<p>How far we have come from this, it seems, in our obsession over homosexual marriage, for example. How intolerant and even fearful we have become of people who do not live the way we do. Yet I am not interested in changing the minds of people who are repulsed or horrified by gay marriage. I only wish they were Jefferson-minded enough to separate their politics from their feelings.</p>

<p>Though people with feelings draft laws, laws are not merely about feelings. If that were true, the Constitution could never be seen as it is today, namely as a guarantee of the rights of citizens other than propertied white males. It was and remains the willingness to disregard the original feelings of the people who wrote the Constitution, to see it in another light, that makes it a valuable and viable charter of governance.</p>

<p>The Republicans are a bit schizophrenic on this issue, too. One the one hand, they prefer strict constructionist judges on the Supreme Court, i.e., those who keep the framer’s intentions in mind, in order that ‘new’ rights (such as the right to abortion) are not ‘discovered’ in the document. However, at the beginning of the 112th Congress, they preferred not to read aloud the Constitution as those very same men wrote it, deeming (not inaccurately) that it would not be such a keen idea to read into the record, patriotic chests a-puff, the definition of a slave (read: black person) as three-fifths of a person. Take what you like and leave the rest… off the record.</p>

<p>Republicans love freedom, but as an adulterous man loves his wife: he shows up with her in public when only when necessary, not out of true fidelity. These convenient appearances include the use of freedom as a buzz word for unfettered capitalism (your personal liberty equals the rights of rich people not to pay high taxes – see Frank Thomas’s piece in <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2011/03/0083329" target="_blank">March’s Harpers</a>) and occasions where perpetuating ignorance is useful (my correcting your ignorance about Obama’s religion or birthplace is an infringement on your personal liberty, so I’ll let laissez-faire rule the day – see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYEqCyYZ0FE" target="_blank">John Boehner’s statement on Meet the Press</a>).
How does ignorance become a liberty worth protecting while reproductive choice remains under attack? The politics of repugnance, that’s how. Otherwise known as the politics of self-serving hypocrisy, which is not really politics at all.</p>
