<blockquote>
  <p>In some ways, the reasons for reducing [a pregnancy] to a singleton are not so different from the decision to abort a pregnancy because prenatal tests reveal anomalies. In both cases, the pregnancies are wanted, but not when they entail unwanted complications—complications for the parents as much as the child. Many studies show the vast majority of patients abort fetuses after prenatal tests reveal genetic conditions like Down syndrome that are not life-threatening. What drives that decision is not just concern over the quality of life for the future child but also the emotional, financial or social difficulty for parents of having a child with extra needs. As with reducing two healthy fetuses to one, the underlying premise is the same: this is not what I want for my life.</p>

<h3 id="sex-with-the-sun-goddess">Sex with the Sun Goddess</h3>
<p>I was listening to Fresh Air the other day, and Terri Gross was interviewing C. Peter Wagner, the namer of and prominent figure in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/03/140946482/apostolic-leader-weighs-religions-role-in-politics">new charismatic Christian movement that seeks to take dominion over politics, business and culture in preparation for the end times and Jesus’ return</a>. The members of this movement espouse some ideas that range from the traditional (from a religious right point of view) to the downright bizarre. Wagner, who came across as a down-to-earth religious elder type, a person more interested in spreading the Gospel than spreading hate, is nonetheless perhaps best known for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yIgZPTqUIc">viral video</a> in which he argues that Japan’s Shinto-dominated culture is responsible for its longterm economic woes—as well as its recent climatic ones.</p>

<p>Specifically, the origin of the difficulties is in a ceremony in which the emperor, according to Wagner, has sex with the sun goddess in a ceremony called <em>diajo-sai</em>. Here is a description of the final part of the ceremony, as <a href="&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthronement_of_the_Japanese_Emperor#The_Daijo-sai">as described on Wikipedia</a>. Amaterasu is the Sun Goddess.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kneeling on a mat situated to face the Grand Shrine of Ise, the emperor makes an offering of the sacred rice, the sake made from this rice, millet, fish and a variety of other foods from both the land and the sea, to Amaterasu. Then he eats some of this sacred rice himself, as an act of divine communion which consummates his singular unity with Amaterasu, thus making him (in Shinto tradition) the intermediary between Amaterasu and the Japanese people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m no Shinto scholar, but this element of the enthronement ceremony of the Japanese emperor seems more rooted in agrarian-based traditions that emphasize connection to the harvest and communion with the land’s fertility. Indeed, <em>daijo-sai</em> means Great Thanksgiving Festival. To sensationalize this practice as “sex” seems as limiting as labeling the Christian Eucharist (also known as communion) a form of cannibalism.</p>

<p>Sex-sationalism aside, Wagner’s ultimate point is theological, namely, that all gods that are not God are forces of evil, or Satan. (Indeed, perhaps the mention of sex is a convenient and catchy shorthand for evil.) From the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sun goddess is not a very nice lady. The sun goddess is a power of darkness, which is headed up by the kingdom of Satan. And so the sun goddess wants natural disasters to come to Japan. Sometimes the hand of God, which is more powerful, will prevent them. And when he decides to prevent them and when he doesn’t is far beyond anything that we can predict.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in this case, God could have prevented that tsunami and the destruction, but he didn’t. He just took his hand off and allowed these natural forces to work. And one of the background pieces of information is Japan is under control of the sun goddess.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with cause-and-effect claims regarding evil and disaster; <a href="http://www.actupny.org/YELL/falwell.html">Jerry Falwell blamed everyone he dislikes</a> (pagans, feminists, abortionists, homosexuals) for the terrorist attacks of 9/11. What interests me here isn’t the hatred angle, since, as I said, Wagner convincingly (to me, anyway) represented himself as a man who, while he doesn’t believe that “homosexuality is God’s Plan A,” is far more interested in sharing the Gospel as a source of betterment, both for individuals and for the world at large. While the promotion of the evangelical platform as the only and/or best way to do this strikes me as naive, I can’t say I am outraged by the goal of greater peace and plenty for a greater number of human beings. Indeed, far from outraged by it, I share it.</p>

<p>What strikes me instead is Wagner’s view of nature, specifically the concept of contingency with regard to it. For him, God’s will is a constant work-in-progress—he created the earth and the heavens, but this was just the groundwork, as he also creates the weather on a day-to-day basis. On those grounds, God himself causes earthquakes and tsunamis, or doesn’t. Moreover, these “choices” are contingent on something other than mere caprice.
Let’s contrast this with some eloquent words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At times other forces cause us to question the ableness of God. The stark and colossal reality of evil in the world—what Keats calls “the giant agony of the world”; ruthless floods and tornadoes that wipe away people as though they were weeds in an open field; ills like insanity plaguing some individuals from birth and reducing their days to tragic cycles of meaninglessness; the madness of war and the barbarity of man’s inhumanity to man—why, we ask, do these things occur if God is able to prevent them? This problem, the problem of evil, has always plagued the mind of man. I would limit my response to an assertion that much of the evil we experience is caused by man’s folly and ignorance and also by the misuse of his freedom. Beyond this, I can say only that there is and always will be a penumbra of mystery surrounding God. What appears at the moment to be evil may have a purpose that our finite minds are incapable of comprehending. So in spite of the presence of evil and the doubts that lurk in our minds, we shall wish not to surrender the conviction that our God is able. (110-111)</p>
  <h4 id="our-god-is-able-the-strength-to-love">—”Our God is Able” (<em>The Strength to Love</em>)</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>God’s will is too expansive, and therefore too mysterious, to be conceived of by the human mind. King does not deny evil here, or man’s ability to do evil, but he does rule out a simplistic relationship between our actions and what we perceive as God’s restraint from acting against evil—or what we perceive as evil. Elsewhere, he also draws a distinction between God and nature, the latter which “must honor ever-lastingly her fixed, immutable laws. When these laws are violated, she has no alternative except to follow inexorably her path of uniformity. Nature does not and cannot forgive.” (“Love in Action,” <em>The Strength to Love</em>, p. 34) In this way, a man who falls from a tall building cannot be understood as either willed by God to keep falling toward the earth or not prevented by God from doing so. The relationship between God and nature is not as simplistic as the latter being an ever-mutable expression of the former’s contingent will. In short, one shouldn’t take gravity—or tsunamis—personally.</p>

<h3 id="the-expanding-universe">The Expanding Universe</h3>
<p>Last week, Saul Perlmutter (UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Adam Riess (Johns Hopkins University) and Brian Schmidt (Australian National University) <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-sci-nobel-expanding-universe-20111005,0,3011276.story">were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics</a> for their discovery that the universe is expanding at an increasing rate, rather than a decreasing rate, as had been previously assumed. Riess was on the team led by Schmidt; Perlmutter and his team came to the same conclusion independently.</p>

<p>While working on a post-doc in 1997, Riess initially thought the results of his calculations on the distance of tell-tale Type 1a supernovae were incorrect. The theory at the time was that the force of gravity had been gradually slowing the expansion of the universe—an expansion initiated at the moment in time called the Big Bang—and that eventually, gravity would lead to a subsequent contraction of the universe, called the Big Crunch. The experiments in which Riess was participating were designed to measure the rate of this deceleration.</p>

<p>In a total revision of that theory, the Nobelists posit the existence of “dark energy” as the force responsible for an increasing rate of expansion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The two teams proposed that the acceleration could be explained by the repulsive force of dark energy, which is now estimated to make up 73% of the universe. (Dark matter, which is unrelated to dark energy, makes up 23% of the universe, and all visible matter a mere 4%.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leaves me wondering if the theory of the Big Crunch still applies—even though I know I won’t be around for it, I prefer the idea of endless expansion, endless entropy, to a cosmic calling-in of all celestial bodies, both light and dark, matter and anti-matter.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is a bit cavalier to express philosophical preferences about matters that are treated as weighty scientific truths—or equally seriously dismissed as deluded apostasy. What the scientists and the creationists—and the creationist scientists, too—have in common is that it interests them how the universe began, it matters to them. In my mind, whether this interest takes the form of wanting to teach the Bible in a science course or studying the distant stars, it is the same interest, the same compelling pull of the forces of light and dark, albeit differently understood. And so is the belief that, with enough faith or enough research, respectively, we can know the origin of things.</p>

<p>I’m not a doubter, per se, of either the Bible or of Science. I find the idea of teaching “creationism” in schools as part of a science curriculum preposterous and indeed insulting—to the Bible. Whether received as sacred word or as literary/historical text, it doesn’t seem to me to be asking to be part of Science, about which I think it could frankly care less. Science is a different kind of Truth, based on different assumptions and different experiences; while that appears to upset certain people, it doesn’t upset the Bible.</p>

<p>At the end of a gorgeous fall day, it occurs to me that the creation of the world in six days and the redshift of supernova revealing an acceleration in the expansion rate of the universe are both narratives, and they matter far more as narratives than as anything else. I have no doubt that the former will continue to be read and pondered, the latter researched and revised. And the sun will continue to rise and set, at least for now.</p>

<p>I have faith and I have curiosity. But I also know I feel differently day to day, month to month, year to year. I don’t believe everything I think, as much as I enjoy thinking. And I can’t make a spider’s leg, or a zucchini, or a rose petal. I’m limited and I’m okay with that; truth with a lowercase ‘t’ is fine. Frankly, I prefer to contemplate the penumbra of mystery.</p>

<h3 id="choices">Choices</h3>
<p>For the book I am writing, I have been reading about the field of Disability Studies. This discipline questions the concept of disability as something that exists outside the social construct of what it calls ‘ableism’. While certain people may possess impairments, such as a missing limb, or the inability to see, hear, or walk, it is society and its practices that transforms these impairments into disabilities.</p>

<p>In this diagnosis-obsessed age, where many child behaviors that a generation ago would have been ascribed to individual temperament are today given fancy names (and often, “treatment” in the form of powerful medications), Disability Studies provides a provocative reminder of the constructedness, and therefore the arbitrariness, of notions such as health and illness, able and unable, sane and mad. The purpose of this awareness is not to minimize the impact of any condition, illness or impairment on a person or family, but rather to recognize that our understanding of these conditions, etc., are not only mutable but often predetermined without our awareness.
To understand what I mean, let’s examine the condition known as Down Syndrome. Or rather, let’s examine an article written by John M. Starbuck entitled “<a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=jca">On the Antiquity of Trisomy 21: Moving Towards a Quantitative Diagnosis of Down Syndrome in Historic Material Culture</a>” in which Starbuck attempts to identify visual evidence of Down Syndrome in past sources of material culture, such as painting.</p>

<p>For instance, Starbuck looks at these three paintings, all from the mid-15th century, painted by the Italian Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506). He considers the evidence that these paintings depict children with Down Syndrome strong, based not only on the representation of “several phenotypic features associated with Down syndrome,” but also on reports that Mantegna himself had a child with Trisomy 21. However, Starbuck admits that, alternatively, it is possible that Mantegna’s representation of children may have been due to his “artistic style,” and therefore have no dispositive value as evidence of the historical presence of Down Syndrome.</p>

<p>While it is more likely than not that this chromosomic duplication existed in previous centuries and millennia, Starbuck’s investigation into its history seems flawed in its most basic premise, in that he is trying to look at the past with the eyes of the present. Arguably, this is what we must do inevitably, when we study the remnants of ages past; however, part of scholarship is acquiring additional, contextual knowledge that allows us to see, as it were, through another’s eyes. Starbuck is finding what he is <em>looking for</em>—the phenotypic features associated with Trisomy 21—but completely failing to grasp that that is not what he is <em>looking at</em>—iconic depictions of the Madonna and Child.</p>

<p>Let me try to convince you that my objection to Starbuck’s inquiry is not tautological. It is not a matter of ignorance of chromosomes then and awareness of them now—<em>of course</em> that is the case. My objection is more fundamental, namely that it is a different kind of seeing that gives us icons then and phenotypes now.</p>

<p>The way we see things now has a lot more to do with the medical/scientific tendency to categorize and systematize than we may realize. This trend has its origins not only in philosophical trends regarding scientific observation as the basis of knowledge, but undoubtedly the historical trend toward greater, denser, and more mobile human populations has encouraged this framework in which individuals are viewed as—and, as Disability Studies scholars would argue, often reduced to—exemplars of identified conditions, disorders, diseases, anomalies, etc. While it seems perfectly natural to us to speak of “normal” children and ones with “birth defects,” these interdependent concepts are not only inventions, but relatively recent ones.</p>

<p>A frequently-expressed concern within Disability Studies is the increasing use of selective abortion based on genetic screening. In India and China, it is common to abort females due to a preference for boys; while this kind of selection is neither as widespread nor as socially acceptable here, it is the case that nine out of ten fetuses with Down Syndrome are (quietly) aborted. This statistic suggests, perhaps indisputably, that this condition is undesirable, a status that Disability Studies finds troubling, given its implications for the many individuals alive with Down Syndrome and other “disabilities”. The reasoning goes: “If we continue to abort these fetuses on the basis that they are less normal, and therefore less desirable, what are we saying about the worth of the individuals born with this condition—or any other condition construed as somehow unacceptable?” Or, from a more personal point of view: “If it is acceptable to abort a fetus that is/has X, had my parents known they might have chosen to abort me!”</p>

<p>While this line of reasoning certainly tugs at the heartstrings, I am not convinced by it, as it fails to take into account the most fundamental characteristic of all living things: contingency. Regardless of our preferences, we deal with the reality of the contingent all the time, inevitably. Things happen that we cannot plan for or prevent, and we manage, we cope, sometimes we even thrive. On this basis, I do not think it devalues a disabled person who is now living in the world if a woman chooses to abort a fetus that has what the medical establishment conceives of as a genetic “abnormality” or “defect”. One has no bearing on the other. Certainly the choice to abort expresses the opinion of the woman about her continued willingness to carry and raise the child—indeed, it constitutes a refusal. But I would hesitate to construe this refusal as an ethical pronouncement on the value of “life,” whether in general or of specific individuals. How can one person in one action condone or refuse something so big, so expansive, so obviously in excess of one’s own limited capacity?</p>

<p>While I believe that refusal is within her rights—by the fact that it is within her capacity—I do not equate this refusal with a moral declaration of any sort. All of our lives are so fundamentally contingent, that to speak about a “right” to be born or a “right” to live in the sense of a moral prerogative seems at best idealistic and at worst fatally naive. I do not judge a woman who aborts a fetus with Down Syndrome; the narrative of “this is not what I want for my life” is one we all use to navigate the myriad choices that define and redefine our lives. You may find this narrative selfishly repugnant, you may have sympathy with it. At the heart of both is the common struggle with contingency. The woman who aborts based on genetic tests refuses ultimately in ignorance, for she cannot know what that child will really be like, what she will feel, what will be the nature of the care she must give. She can assume, she can fear, but she cannot know. The woman who does not abort also does so in ignorance, for to carry and raise any child carries the same level of contingency, as the same abyss of ignorance yawns before each new life—even those magical, precious “perfectly healthy babies.”</p>

<p>The only sure thing is contingency. Everything is contingent but God.</p>
