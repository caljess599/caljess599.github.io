<p>Safe to say, no one likes to be rejected. In addition to not getting what we want, we often feel personally attacked or hurt, andwe may even begin to question our own judgment about our qualities and competencies, be it in the professional world or in the messy realms of romance. At best, we can shake off one person or one firm or one editor’s opinion and find the courage and hope to move on with our mission. At worst, however, we become self-doubting, defeatist, cynical.

Though no one likes to be rejected, anyone who has ever received a particularly mean rejection letter is aware that some people seem to take a definite pleasure in rejecting others. Nothing makes someone feel superior like enumerating the shortcomings of another’s effort. We feel easily justified in our opinions of work created by others, in general but especially when we have been appointed the task of discrimination, of evaluating whether something is good enough.</p>

<p>Of course, even when something has passed muster with a producer or publisher, there is always someone ready to find fault. Indeed, there are people who are employed to do just this, and we accept the legitimacy of book reviewers and movie critics–even though it is far easier to criticize something than it is to create it.</p>

<p>Happily, though, the great spectrum of human opinion counteracts the pervasiveness of the critical instinct–knock on enough doors, and behind one of them you’ll likely find someone sympathetic to your cause. Indeed, the stories of numerous rejections of later-famous writers (Jack London springs to mind)  seem to imply that rejection is a haphazard force, one not to be taken too seriously. Though its blows may be hard, and numerous, they are like the wind, subject, mercifully, to change.</p>
