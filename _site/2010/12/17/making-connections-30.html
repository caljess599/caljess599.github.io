    <h1>Making Connections</h1>

<p>Your brain has a default network that is always on but needs idle time, which it gets in nondreaming sleep as well as during intense and focused intellectual activity. (Is this like saying TV is bad for you?)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another line of research involves the brain’s default network: a system of cells that is always turned on at some level. It includes the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center, but also other areas, and is the brain’s mind-wandering mode — the part that is active when, for instance, you’re driving in your car and you start thinking about what you will make for dinner. That brain system, scientists find, is exactly the network that is attacked by Alzheimer’s, and protecting it in some way might help keep the brain healthier longer. For example, during nondreaming sleep, the default network is thought to be less active, like a light bulb that has been dimmed. The network also ramps down during intense and focused intellectual activity, which uses different areas of the brain. One emerging theory suggests that if the default network can be rested, amyloid production might be decreased, allowing even an amyloid disposal system that was partly hobbled by Alzheimer’s to do a better job.</p>

<p>Words go in and out of style—you knew that, but now there’s a (google) app for that. Go, digital humanities, go!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can, for instance, type in a word or a short phrase, and the database produces a graph—a curve that traces how often an author used those words every year since 1800. “And you realize that it’s fantastically addictive,” says Jean-Baptiste Michel, a mathematician and biologist at Harvard who created the new database together with [Erez Lieberman] Aiden. “You can just spend hours and hours typing in the names of people you know, places you like, or just random stuff. And so you end up discovering quite a lot of things that way.” The researchers discovered, for instance, that the trajectory of fame—the curve that shows how often a very famous person is mentioned in books—has changed over the centuries. Today, fame is more fleeting. “You become famous earlier in life; so fame knocks on your door earlier than before. And then you rise to fame even faster than before. The flip side of this is that you become forgotten also somewhat faster than before,” says Michel. Specific years—1973, for instance—also seem to fade from the literary record more quickly nowadays. And God got a lot of print in the early 19th century, but not today.</p>

<p>Don’t believe everything you think. Or rather, what you believe is what you think. Even scientists know about taking things on faith.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The decline effect is actually a decline of illusion. While Karl Popper imagined falsification occurring with a single, definitive experiment—Galileo refuted Aristotelian mechanics in an afternoon—the process turns out to be much messier than that. Many scientific theories continue to be considered true even after failing numerous experimental tests. Verbal overshadowing might exhibit the decline effect, but it remains extensively relied upon within the field. The same holds for any number of phenomena, from the disappearing benefits of second-generation antipsychotics to the weak coupling ratio exhibited by decaying neutrons, which appears to have fallen by more than ten standard deviations between 1969 and 2001. Even the law of gravity hasn’t always been perfect at predicting real-world phenomena. […] Despite these findings, second-generation antipsychotics are still widely prescribed, and our model of the neutron hasn’t changed. The law of gravity remains the same. Such anomalies demonstrate the slipperiness of empiricism. Although many scientific ideas generate conflicting results and suffer from falling effect sizes, they continue to get cited in the textbooks and drive standard medical practice. Why? Because they ideas seem true. Because they make sense. Because we can’t bear to let them go. […] The decline effect is troubling because it reminds us how difficult it is to prove anything. We like to pretend that our experiments define the truth for us. But that’s often not the case. Just because an idea is true doesn’t mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn’t mean it’s true. When the experiments are done, we still have to chose what to believe.</p>
