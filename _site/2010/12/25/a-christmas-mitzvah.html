    <h1>A Christmas Mitzvah</h1>
<p>25 Dec 2010</p>

<p>Today I went and visited my great-aunt Lillian in the “manor” where she lives in Dania Beach, FL. At my grandmother’s direction, I stopped at the Walgreen’s (open on Christmas Day, thank you die-hard capitalists!) across the street to buy her some hairspray, which apparently is one of her favorite things and something they are often out of at the Manor’s store. It’s nice to come bearing gifts.</p>

<p>Lillian is my grandmother’s only remaining sibling. My grandmother is the youngest of 6 (she was “a change of life baby,” to quote her today) and so my great-aunt, the fourth-born, was already 15 when Rita arrived. With five siblings out of childhood, Rita was raised by her brothers and sisters, who showered that sweet child (as Lillian described her) with attention, not only out of kindness, but out of necessity, since her mother was quite ill by that point, and no longer a young woman.</p>

<p>Lillian is 102, set to turn 103 in March 2011. She has outlived her son, sadly, by nearly a decade, and her husband by nearly two. She is quite frank about not understanding why she is still alive… “Enough already!” is her refrain. Especially since either her eyes or her eyeglasses have changed (apparently in an assisted living facility, things are constantly moving or subject to substitution/disappearance, either for real or in the minds of the residents, or a combination thereof) she is unable to read. (When the eye doctor makes his next visit, the situation will be addressed.)</p>

<p>Time, she says, “hangs on her hands,” as it might for all of us at a point in our lives when family is reduced or far away, and the geographic circle of our existence is tightly circumscribed. Lillian is in remarkable shape. She is a bit hard of hearing, and she is liable to confuse names and lineage of people (niece is close enough, and no one calls anyone by the right name in our family, routinely), but she knows who we are, and I was a most welcome visitor.</p>

<p>Other than that, she is still completely lucid, her wits about her, and her memories of the past quite vivid, and her grasp of the present entirely cogent. Up until a few years ago, she lived in a different assisted living facility, much more high-end, and much more expensive. She had her own apartment, but she didn’t interact with very many people.</p>

<p>When it became time to move, my grandmother didn’t think she’d last more than a few weeks in the new place–she was sharing a room (she now has a single) and her former lifestyle was gone forever. And yet she thrived. Though she recalls her former home fondly now (when at the time she did not have that much good to say about it), and she complains about the food at the Manor, she is obviously doing very well.</p>

<p>Unbelievable, but true–you can change your life for the better even at 100. The way she reflects on how she came to be living there, with surprise, acknowledging that she could never have anticipated these circumstances, namely, living so long, exhausting her savings (“you either have to be very rich or a pauper,” she says, accurately summing up the current situation of eldercare in America), is much the way any of us, if we are at all prone to self-reflection, might look at the changes in our own lives that we didn’t anticipate.</p>

<p>Life truly is–be it at 30 or 103–what happens when you are making other plans. Lillian is open about her feelings about not understanding why she is still alive, but she gives no impression of being depressed. With a graceful acceptance, she sums it up by saying that the Manor has some good aspects and some bad, much like everything.</p>

<p>This thing call aging, this state called old age, a destination to which we are all headed–if illness doesn’t take us in our prime, or at least primer, years–is mysterious, even though it its mysteriousness is the opposite of death, which of course is also our shared final destination. While it is hard to imagine death because no one can tell us about it, there are plenty of old people around for us to observe and talk to about being old. I look at my aunt, who is <em>more than 3 times older than me</em> (unreal!), and I see her slackened skin and shrunken muscles, and I think, somehow, if I’m lucky, that will happen to me… And yet even as I see crow’s feet beginning to perch around my eyes, I cannot imagine it.</p>

<p>I know that our culture is going to experience, by necessity, a huge change in regard to how older people are cared for in the next 10-20 years, as there is no way that the current infrastructure is equipped to handle the baby boomers as they head into their 60s, 70s and beyond–and it is also unlikely that the current model is feasible economically, even if the infrastructure existed. If you retire at 65, or even 67 or 70, and you need several thousand dollars a month to provide for your needs, and you may live another 10 to 20 years or more, you are more than likely to run out of money before you die, even if you have saved diligently for retirement.</p>

<p>My mother is fond of speculating that the baby boomers are going to do things differently by choice, perhaps relaunching the commune concept, forming their own shared/assisted living communities based on friendship. I also foresee the concept of inter-generational communities becoming more and more important, and providing structures for care for both the old and the young. If the current model is to outsource, so to speak, the care of older relatives, collecting them in assisted living facilities, the coming model will be somewhat of a cultural throwback, encouraging the reconsideration of the nuclear family as the ideal (economic and social) manifestation of the American Dream.</p>

<p>Anyway, my aunt now has plenty of hairspray.</p>
