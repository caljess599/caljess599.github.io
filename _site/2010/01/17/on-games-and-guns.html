        <p>Even within the exciting and glamorous realm that is professional sports, life isn’t all fun and games.</p>

<p>In Cabinda, Angola, a bus carrying the soccer team of Togo to the African Cup of Nations was attacked by gunmen, purportedly belonging to a Cabindan separatist movement (Cabinda is a northern enclave of Angola that is geographically separated from the rest of the country by a strip of Congo). Three people—the bus driver, an assistant coach, and a team spokesperson—were killed, and several team members were injured.</p>

<p>The politicization of sporting events is not a new concept, whether a matter of patriotic significance (e.g., the “Miracle on Ice”, where the US Olympic ice hockey team defeated the Soviets in a medal-round game in February 1980) or of terrorist attack (e.g., the â€˜Munich Massacre’, where a militant group killed eleven Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, West Germany). However, we still like to think that sports exist apart, the sacred values of sportsmanship and the purity of objective (well, pace ice skating judging) competition overcomes the (often nasty) subjective political (or racial, or economic) conflicts, in whose midst sports are inevitably played.</p>

<p>If getting shot at on your way to the game doesn’t ring true as a likely event in America, the domestic equivalent to the unfortunate Angolan incident may just be the bringing up on gun charges of Washington Wizards’ Gilbert Arenas, stemming from a Dec. 21 incident where he allegedly brandished several (unloaded) guns at a teammate in the locker room of the Verizon Center. Arenas claimed that he was storing the guns in his locker in order to keep them away from his young children.</p>

<p>Arenas was immediately suspended from playing—indefinitely—and on Jan. 15, as the result of a plea bargain, pled guilty to a single count of carrying a pistol without a license in the District of Columbia—a felony charge under D.C.’s strict gun laws.</p>

<p>Whether Arenas was acting in ignorance of D.C. law (and also of the NBA’s collective bargaining agreement, which prohibits firearms in an NBA area) or out of a genuine desire to threaten his teammate, Javaris Crittenton (with whom he was purportedly involved in a dispute over card-game gambling losses) the incident highlights the often tense relationship between sports culture and the greater cultural context in which it exists. While it is safe to say that we have given up on the non-commercialization of professional sports–the days of athletes making less than a doctor or lawyer are gone forever—we still seem to cling to the idea that we can wall off the sports arena from cultural trends—in this case, the pervasiveness of a gun-owning and gun-flashing culture, most noticeable in the (wildly opposite) contexts of street gangs and hip-hop music videos. You can ban guns from the arena, but it’s apparently a lot harder to take away whatever it is that makes people who have it all—success, fame, the fun of the game—want guns, too.</p>
