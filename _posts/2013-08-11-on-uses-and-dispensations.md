> Money should be spent trying out concepts that shatter current structures and systems that have turned much of the world into one vast market. Is progress really Wi-Fi on every street corner? No. It's when no 13-year-old girl on the planet gets sold for sex. But as long as most folks are patting themselves on the back for charitable acts, we've got a perpetual poverty machine. 
#### —Peter Buffett, "The Charitable-Industrial Complex"

### Stuck in the Middle World
In _The God Delusion_, Richard Dawkins's latest book decrying the absurdities of religion and denying the existence of God, the author uses the term 'Middle World' to describe the world within a human-scale frame of reference. By middle, Dawkins means to indicate that our brains have developed in response to objects that are neither very small (microorganisms) or very big (astral bodies), but that are in the middle (trees, elephants, mice, grain). While we may understand through science the true nature of matter—namely that it is mostly emptiness—this is not the way our brains have evolved to think naturally.

> ...the way we see the world, and the reason why we find some things intuitively easy to grasp and others hard, is that our brains are themselves evolved organs: on-board computers, evolved to help us survive in a world—I shall use the name Middle World—where the objects that mattered to our survival were neither very large nor very small; a world where things either stood still or moved slowly compared with the speed of light; and where the very improbable could safely be treated as impossible. Our mental burka window is narrow because it didn't _need_ to be any wider in order to assist our ancestors to survive. (412)

Dawkins adopts the image of the burka-draped Muslim woman as an illustrative metaphor for this partial understanding, purposefully appropriating a religious image he associates with extremism and limitation (indeed, oppression). He does this not only to emphasize that all humans share the natural limitation of our evolved eyesight and, in correlation — at least until the advent of the scientific method—our limited mental understanding of the invisible workings of the physical world, but also, of course, to stress that the natural step for human beings is to push our understanding beyond this narrow window. Religion for Dawkins represents at best a refusal to understand the world as science reveals it and at worst the subjection of others to oppressions that are falsely justified by irrational dogmas.

### Invisible Pities

> SECTION 1
> (a) The findings indicate that:
> (1) substantial medical evidence recognizes that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by not later than 20 weeks after fertilization;
> (2) the state has a compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that these children are capable of feeling pain;
> (3) the compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that an unborn child is capable of feeling pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither state interest is intended to replace the other; and
> (4) restricting elective abortions at or later than 20 weeks post-fertilization, as provided by this Act, does not impose an undue burden or a substantial obstacle on a woman's ability to have an abortion because:
> (A) the woman has adequate time to decide whether to have an abortion in the first 20 weeks after fertilization; and
> (B) this Act does not apply to abortions that are necessary to avert the death or substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman or abortions that are performed on unborn children with severe fetal abnormalities.
> (b) The legislature intends that every application of this statute to every individual woman shall be severable from each other. In the unexpected event that the application of this statute is found to impose an impermissible undue burden on any pregnant woman or group of pregnant women, the application of the statute to those women shall be severed from the remaining applications of the statute that do not impose an undue burden, and those remaining applications shall remain in force and unaffected, consistent with Section 10 of this Act.

Although my readers may be forgiven for assuming so, I actually didn't enjoy the (many) parts of _The God Delusion_ where Dawkins ridicules religious extremists. Extremists of all sorts are ridiculous, or at least easily ridiculed, and to dismiss religion _in toto_ based on the Westboro Baptist Church or the Taliban is like dismissing cooking based on restrictavors (am I coining a phrase?) and freegans. Naturally, it is one thing to have a meal ruined by a screaming vegan and another to be bomb-blasted at the Boston Marathon, so it follows that we are likely to be more collectively concerned with militant Islam than with militant foodies. But the threat of danger aside (not just violence but also the restriction of the rights associated with non-belief), it is not an interesting intellectual exercise to point out to crazed Biblical literalists the contradiction in terms between the protection of 'innocent' (unborn) lives and the murder of abortion doctors—or, for that matter, to point out the fact that the born-again Christian George W. Bush, as Governor of Texas, [presided over the state-sanctioned execution of 152 people](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/george-bush-executed-texans-at-faster-rate-than-rick-perry/).

Although Dawkins does not pursue this line of thinking, his analysis suggests a far more interesting line of inquiry in the context of the fanatical politicization of 'life' at its neo-natal and neo-mort stages. As the text of the new Texas law shows, these lawmakers (at least those who are not driven purely by craven political expediency) have begun to interpret their role as protectors of the public good from a standpoint skewed away from the typical political sphere of the Middle World—life outside of the home, among local residents—and toward the Micro World of zygotes and fetuses. Without the advances of science, we would have no way to see the very initial stages of life, and therefore no model in which to discuss its characteristics, including its ability to feel pain. For centuries, this invisibility meant that [the quickening of the fetus](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2005/06/the_consciometer.html), i.e., its first clear movement, was considered threshold of conscious life, and thus the dividing line between legal and illegal abortions.

Of course, the decision to view the prevention of pain as a primary interest of the state is not a scientific question but a philosophical one. Certainly on the level of personal philosophy, the advancement of science is mixed up in there somewhere, given that along with the development of ever greater ways to manipulate and control our internal chemical environments has come the prevailing attitude that pain is the enemy and that a modern, civilized life—especially an American one—should be pain-free. But as a state interest, it does not suggest itself as an obvious candidate, especially given that the causes of pain in any given individual life are multiple and multifactorial, and thus can hardly all be prevented. (Are they to pass an Act for the Prevention of Skinned Knees in the next session?) Indeed, the majority of laws, state and national, do not have as their goal the mitigation of physical pain.

Thus we ought to see the pain of the unborn not as an instance of a general state interest in pain prevention, but rather a specific one: specific to both the pre-human _qua_ pre-human, and also to the type of pain being experienced, i.e., the pain that interrupts the process of development. Put another way, the state interest in 'pain prevention' is unique to beings whose experience of this pain would be caused by termination. Once the threshold of fetal viability is crossed, as the statute itself makes clear, this pain argument ceases to matter, for the state's interest in protecting those fetuses is not based on the sensation of pain but on their status as separate beings with certain individual rights. Indeed, for many staunch pro-lifers, their attitudes toward pain undergo a stunning reversal at the point of viability, as they argue that every life, no matter how compromised, is worth preserving and sustaining, even if the conditions involved are painful and require extensive, invasive—and arguably painful—medical interventions. (Even separate of the issue of selective abortions based on genetic testing, medical advances are provoking an increasingly difficult situation in regard to severely premature deliveries; while increasingly skillful interventions can save the lives more and more of these unfortunate infants, the question is begged regarding the long-term efficacy of costly procedures whose results are children with lifelong developmental hinderances.)

But to return to the main subject at hand, the pain of the pre-viable fetus is a pain that lacks self-consciousness, and therefore its context is not self-referential but is purely externalized—it is the projected moral agony of those who cherish a theoretical ideal of Life represented by the embryonic form. This is not to say that there is not a height to the moral ground on which the claim against abortion is made; indeed, there is a beautiful neatness to the idea of _letting something grow_ that generally inspires awe. It _is_ the course of nature for living things to grow, to multiply, and once one attaches the notion of the sacred to life, then it is a small step to the notion that life's multiplication is sacred, too. And who doesn't love babies? And on a philosophical level, the notion of _letting live_ contains within it the strength and discipline of restraint; it is so noble an idea that it is easy to forget that an equal part of human life, of our evolution as beings on this planet, consists of manipulation and interference with the natural world. We cut down forests, we kill animals; we till, sow, weed, and harvest the fields; we mine metals; we pollute rivers; we develop drugs to kill cancerous cells; we terminate unwanted pregnancies.

### We Are All Christians
In 1954, the Italian writer Alberto Moravia wrote an essay on the topic of Kant's categorical imperative in which he discussed how Christianity had exhausted itself, proving itself no longer capable of effectively rendering, through its conception of the sacred, man as an end rather than a means. The post-war political climate, as well as the atrocities of the Shoah, just barely in the rear-view mirror, provided for Moravia ample proof:

> Christianity has made all men Christians without exception, and as it cannot make them more than Christians it no longer has any part to play. The men who in our own time, by aberrant experiments and destinies, are used as means to attain certain human ends, are in fact neither pagans nor Neanderthal men—they are Christians. And their executioners are Christians too. And with the fat of Christians exterminated by other Christians during the last war, soap was made; and with their ashes the fields of other Christians were fertilized. Hitler was every bit as much a Christian as the Pope and Roosevelt. A proof of this was that, though his reason or reasons of state allowed him to commit nothing but crimes, he never managed to delude himself entirely into thinking that these crimes were not crimes—which is why he took such care to conceal them and destroy their traces up to the last minute.

The truth of all this is manifest both in the impotence of Christianity to save men a second time from slavery, and in the uneasiness that slavery arouses in us. In other words, we are Christians psychologically, but on the ethical plane—that is, on the operative plane—we are no longer Christians, precisely because we are Christians psychologically. [...] The early Christians remained psychologically pagan for a long time, which was the reason and explanation of their acceptance of the Christian ethic. It took twenty centuries to make man psychologically Christian, hence depriving Christianity's ethical function of authority.

> We now find that we are faced not by one end only but by innumerable ones which, though perfectly rational, are all materialist and inhuman, and on all sides man is turned into a means to attain these ends. [...] Christianity had the quality of setting man as an end and not making use of him to attain that end. ("Man As An End," from _Man As An End: A Defense of Humanism_, 30-1)

If Moravia's point is that Christianity has faded into the background to the extent that its precepts are ignorable to the point of global war and technologically-aided genocide, then my point, based on Dawkins's observations, is that currently Christianity has gotten sucked into the Micro World to the point where it cannot see the forest from the trees; the religious right is so busy trying to protect the unborn that they have no will left to be concerned with the post-born, i.e., the living. They are so concerned with Life that they forget about life—and it is the one with the small letter that we are all living.

This is a common charge from the left, namely, that the right wants all children to be born, but does not want to use public money to feed, house, and educate them after they are born. Democrats, who are now basically defined by their whole-hog pro-choice stance, often defend their position based on this 'facts-on-the-ground' observation: why should we condemn a poor mother of four to bear another child she doesn't want and can't afford? It is pragmatism on an individual and a societal level, one that is often attacked by the right for being callous and self-serving, e.g., parents who don't want a special-needs child are selfish; the promoters of abortion in American are perpetrating a genocide against African Americans.

It is worth noting that there used to be a strain of liberals who were pro-life. [Eunice Kennedy](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/opinion/31douthat.html?_r=0) is a great example; guided by her staunch Roman Catholicism, she "saw a continuity, rather than a contradiction, between championing the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed and protecting unborn human life." In 1992, she was a member of a number of pro-life Democrats who urged the Democratic National Convention to reconsider its abortion-on-demand position in its platform, proposing

> ...a new understanding, one that does not pit mother against child. To establish justice and to promote the general welfare, America does not need the abortion license. What America needs are policies that responsibly protect and advance the interest of mothers _and_ their children, both before _and_ after birth. Such policies would provide maximum feasible legal protection for the unborn and maximum feasible care and support for pregnant women, mothers, and children.

In the eyes of these pro-life Democrats, the notion that abortion-on-demand was necessary for women's social equality/advancement (and that conversely requiring them to bear unplanned children was a source of suffering) "reflects a terrible failure of moral imagination and social responsibility and an appalling lack of respect for women." Although the text contains no mention of contraception, and only one vague reference to "family planning," one might hopefully assume that part of a more imaginative social plan for women is not just more social and financial support for mothers but also free and ubiquitous access to birth control. This is of course a sticky issue for those Democrats who pro-life stance is motivated by religious principles, as the Roman Catholic Church is no more keen on contraception than it is on abortion.

To the extent that the political debate about abortion has been driven by religious principles, it remains a debate about sex, in particular the contexts in which women _should_ be having sex. At its worse, the idea that a woman should not only expect but desire to become pregnant each time she has intercourse is a reduction of her body and mind to a biological vessel of procreation—and this religious view has been heartily and justifiably derided as the highest form of sexism. But that is not to say that there is not a measure of honor accorded to the woman in this view; certainly it is a high bar of respect for women if we were to suppose that each time a man had sex with a woman, he did it not merely for his pleasure, but out of love for the woman who might as a result of the act bear his child. On this highest level — even if we acknowledge that this scenario constitutes a fantasy of Edenic proportions — the issue we are discussing is a sexual respect for women. And that, my friends, is clearly a discussion we need to have most urgently.

The Internet is For —
> Porn has evolved from the airbrushed misogyny of glossy spreads in Playbook and smutty films sold in seedy shops. It is corporate and easily available. Its products today focus less on sex between a man and woman and increasingly on groups of men beating off on a woman's face or tearing her anus open with their penises. Porn has evolved to its logical conclusion. It first turned women into sexual commodities and then killed women as human beings. And it has won the culture war. [...]

"Why do deep down within we'd all like to be porn stars at one point in our life or another?" asks Faye Wattleton in complete earnestness on the HBO Special _Thinking XXX_. She is the president of the _[now defunct?]_ [Center for the Advancement of Women](http://www.nndb.com/org/186/000165688/) (86) —Chris Hedges, "The Illusion of Love," _Empire of Illusion:
The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle_

> Everyone is willing to say: pornography is everywhere. Almost no one is willing to say: and I have seen some of it. [...] That squeamishness about detail isn't merely a matter of sociological interest. It has real consequences. It means that the argument about pornography becomes binary: on or off, consensual or exploitative, arousing or repellent. And then, because most of us are instinctively opposed to censorship, we sigh that it's a fact of life, and we just have to put up with all of it. [...] [T]he really important debates about pornography should not be about legal principles, but ethical ones. Here's where my â€“ oh, God, there's no other word for it â€“ expertise comes in. I can tell you, for example, that if you're interested in watching two people having sex (and see no moral problem in that interest) but not so interested in watching women being treated badly, your options are pretty limited.

> A few years ago, I interviewed _The Sun_'s agony aunt Deidre Sanders, who told me that the biggest change in the make-up of her postbag since she took up the role in 1980 was the precipitous growth in letters from men and women whose relationships had been affected by pornography. [...] One study found that 90 per cent of content on the most popular porn sites featured physical or verbal abuse against women, and you don't have to be [Mary Whitehouse](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/763998.stm) to find that concerning. We need to do something about it, and since we are not going to outlaw pornography altogether, we need to figure out what that might be. —Archie Bland, [The Truth About Pornography: It's Time for a Rude Awakening](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-truth-about-pornography-its-time-for-a-rude-awakening-8735043.html)

What I really wanted to talk about in this post was what it means to hear men talk so boldly about porn, something liberals, feminists and the religious right seem to have given up on. Hedges's in-depth and unflinching statement about the ubiquity and crassness of porn, and about either our selective ignorance, displacement, and denial of the truth of the matter is one thing—a brave thing!—but even more impressive is the company it keeps in his book. To talk about victory of pornography—specifically the significance of its violence against women (that cherished trump card of the anti-abortion movement!)—alongside the more recent phenomena of the triumph of celebrity on reality TV, the widening wealth gap in rich nations, and the foolish hucksterism of the new philosophy of happiness constitutes a type of New Critique particular to our present culture.

One of the aspects of this New Critique is to reject the idea that greater permissiveness is always a sign of cultural progress. To take this stand of course is to threaten one of my own sacred cows, that is, my conviction that the full recognition (and increasing acceptance) of gays and lesbians is one of the most significant and remarkable achievements of the last generation (within the places in the world it has occurred). Who am I to say that being gay is okay, but porn isn't? Is there a credible basis on which to make the claim? For humanists, perhaps that would be the notion that violence is inherently immoral, even if its 'victims' are 'willing', and consensual love is another matter. Of course this will not convince the Bible thumpers, despite the [recent remarks of Pope Francis](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/world/europe/pope-francis-gay-priests.html?pagewanted=all).

My concern is not to woo the self-righteous; my interest lies rather in the fact that Hedges's New Critique of porn casts light on the fact that we cannot expect our mere willingness for things to be okay to make them so—while tolerance is much brandied about as a method of achieving better well-being for more people ("live and let live")â€š we cannot simply 'accept' our way toward a new world order. Deciding that the people who make porn and the people who watch it are all free actors, and therefore cannot/should not be subject either to moral judgment or restraint: it is at that moment that we are fooling ourselves that the greatest human value is freedom, and we are perverting the very notion of love—God's love, if you will—through the insistence that human beings can or do know what we are doing with ourselves. And it seems more than abundantly clear that indeed we don't know.

Peter Buffett's short piece on the role of charity in the current world order highlights the fact that neither the Right's fanatical Cult-of-Life dogma (under which abortion is the ultimate and primary evil, [à la Mother Teresa](http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/abortion-kills-conscience-and-destroys-peace-little-known-mother-theresa-in/)) nor the Left's Cult-of-Technology (according to which solar-charged cell phones and micro-loans will cure the world's ills) is asking the proper question about human behavior. The first premise Buffett rejects simply by ignoring it, the second he attacks directly, invoking Matthew 6:3 in regard to the perils of the organized practice of giving: "But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you" (Matt. 6:3-4)

> Because of who my father is, I've been able to occupy some seats I never expected to sit in. Inside any important philanthropy meeting, you witness heads of state meeting with investment managers and corporate leaders. All are searching for answers with their right hand to problems that others in the room have created with their left. There are plenty of statistics that tell us that inequality is continually rising. At the same time, according to the Urban Institute, the nonprofit sector has been steadily growing.... It's a massive business, with approximately [$316 billion](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100831257) given away in 2012 in the United States alone and more than 9.4 million employed.

> Philanthropy has become the "it" vehicle to level the playing field and has generated a growing number of gatherings, workshops and affinity groups.

> As more lives and communities are destroyed by the system that creates vast amounts of wealth for the few, the more heroic it sounds to "give back."

It is too easy to become sentimental about poverty, just as it is too easy to be consoled by the large-scale efforts at philanthropy that are a symptom of inequality rather than a cure. Buffett might have cited another New Testament gem in this regard:

> Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him. Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, said, "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people?" Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it. Therefore Jesus said, "Let her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial. For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me." —John 12:1-8

John, Jesus' best friend, who told his Gospel from the closeness of lived experience and the intimacy of love, shows us both the enduring problems of the current world order and the triumph of habit over information—in this case, Judas's habit of greed. While Judas has been reified into The Betrayer of Christ, the Gospels make clear that there was nothing so genetically or psychologically different about Judas, let alone something unique about his character flaw. Jesus, in his response to Judas's self-righteous objection to Mary's lavish anointing of Jesus, is no sentimentalist: as long as the current world order exists, you're going to have the poor with you. This lack of sentimentality, any good student of the Bible will tell you, comes from the fact that Jesus' perspective isn't the lifespan of one man, but the promise of a new kind of Life for Man, one without injustice, sickness, suffering—and even perhaps without death. That is the change that Jesus has come to announce as on the horizon. Whether you share that hope or not, Buffett's piece does not flinch at the fact that the measure of a human being must be his behavior toward other human beings. Away from the Micro World of embryos and Wi-fi signals there is the Middle World, a world where each person—and in particular each man—chooses how to treat other people—and in particular each woman.

The most irritating element of the abortion debate, in my opinion, is the ridiculous insistence that women who have abortions are killers not just of children but of conscience, a charge that flies in the face of all the love and effort mothers then and now have done for their children and their families. To claim that a mother's love should be spontaneous, endless, and immune to any and all adversity is, frankly, disrespectful of her human limits, and it is all the more hypocritical when there is little or no discussion in these same moral contexts of how men should be behaving. Why is the discussion always that a woman has to want a child every time she has intercourse, and not that a man has to? Why is a man wanting to jack off for pleasure a given, but a woman who wants to get off without consequences evidence of a lack of conscience? Why aren't we outraged about pornography and sex trafficking? Why aren't we calling out the men—and women!—on this planet who watch, create, and sell porn, and the men who abuse and rape women, and who use and sell children for sex?

It is time we ask ourselves why all the outrage is focused on pregnant women. Do we really think that the continuous breeding of all females on earth is magically going to short-circuit all these men behaving badly?

### Keep On Using Me...
The rich get richer now without the manual labor of poor people, indeed, they do so even without the skilled mechanized labor of the vanishing middle class, or the now-endangered educatariat class of degree-holders. If the hippies of the 1960s were co-opted by Wall Street and Madison Avenue to tune back in and make some cash, the world of capital is more than content to leave their children to languish at home. The financial instruments that turn money into more money don't need any more men and women in suits and ties to guard the fort. The fort is off-shore and the guards are machines. The cloud doesn't need you.

As I sit here in a beautiful apartment in a major Germany city, poised at the beginning of a magical year of adventure, I find myself wondering what use the world can find for me—an educated, multi-lingual, cosmopolitan woman who always imagined that her talents and intelligence would make some sort of contribution to her community. Increasingly, though, the world elite seem to be saying that if you cannot help me make money—if your skills do not create profit—then I have no role for you. This is happening to men as well as women, but for women, it comes with the ever-present additional danger that for many, many men on the planet—perhaps an increasing number of them—women are merely objects for their sexual pleasure. Children, also, are increasingly exploited by adults as sexual objects.

Can we not be of use to one another as ends in ourselves? Or are we condemned to a world of using one another... until we are all used up?
