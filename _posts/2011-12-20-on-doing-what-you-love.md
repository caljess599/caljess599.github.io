title: On Doing What You Love
---

<blockquote>Writing is what's important to me, and anything that helps me do that -- or enhances and prolongs and deepens and sometimes intensifies argument and conversation -- is worth it to me... [It's] impossible for me to imagine having my life without going to those parties, without having those late nights, without that second bottle."</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">--Christopher Hitchens (1949-2011), <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html" target="_blank">on having no regrets
about years of heavy smoking and drinking</a></p>

<h3>Reason for the Season</h3>
The end of the year is a traditional time to take stock of the 365 previous days, and as good a chance as any to gear up for the next solar go-round. Not that the everyday business of living and dying ceases, though. Indeed, the final fortnight of 2011 has seen the death of several notable persons, including the above-quoted Christopher Hitchens.

Hitchens was a polemicist, someone who enjoyed not only sharing his opinion as an author and journalist, but also sparring with others as a commentator and speaker on television, where his wit and willingness put him in high demand. He had ideals, but he was too catholic in his critiques to be considered an ideologue. He wrote a book on Mother Teresa entitled <em>The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice</em>. He was, as William Grimes puts it in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html" target="_blank">New York Times obit</a>, "an equal-opportunity abuser."

<!--more-->Much was made of the fact that Hitchens was an outspoken atheist, a position which he elaborated in the best-selling 2007 book <em>God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything</em>. You have to admire someone who gets up on that particular soapbox in America, the country he adopted as his home in 1981. Despite the notable discretion of the founding fathers on this issue, these days, it is for all intents and purposes impossible to engage in presidential politics without at least giving credible lip-service to religious faith.

In a country where atheism has progressed from visceral associations with the anti-American politics of the left (think McCarthy and the Red Scare) to virulent accusations of leftist, corporatist conspiracies (think Glenn Beck and <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/201011090036" target="_blank">his anti-Semitic attack on George Soros</a>), Hitchens is not only brave but battle-savvy. He wasn't the kind of dovish liberal that hawks love to pigeonhole: he broke with the International Socialists in 1982 to support the Falklands War, and later came out in favor of the invasion of Iraq -- a view that led to his break with the left-wing weekly <em>The Nation, </em>for which he was a long-time correspondent.

For Hitchens, religion was indelibly associated with the things he hated: dictatorship, stupidity, censorship. He believed in the threat of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamofascism" target="_blank">Islamofascism</a>" -- a term he popularized though denied coining. He once quipped to Sean Hannity, who was trying to make a case for an all-seeing God: "It would be like living in North Korea." Those who hoped (to Hitchens' great amusement) that his illness would prompt a late-life conversion clearly misinterpreted his atheism as a lack of passion, unable to see the strength he gained from a hard-thought rejection of dogma, the solace he took in being his own man.
<h3>Gifted</h3>
As this will be my final post of 2011, I couldn't help taking a scroll down short-term memory lane. This has been a transformative year for the blog, the year in which I started a biweekly posting cycle that seems to suit me and the variety of writing circumstances in which I have found myself this year. Rereading my reflections on current events -- whether global or personal in scale -- I realize how much I enjoy the regular challenge of putting together a piece on a reasonably short, self-imposed deadline.

In the spirit of acknowledging the pleasures of personal pursuits, it seems appropriate to follow up on <a href="http://www.lightthetunnel.net/?p=78">my midyear reflections about the "room of my own,"</a> namely, the tremendous opportunity I have had for the last six months to devote a large amount of time to pursuing the arts I love: writing and making music.

These passions are hardly new to me, but for a variety of reasons, my relationship to them has altered significantly over the last calendar year. Perhaps I should acknowledge here the fact that I understand the role of activities in my life similar to the way I do my interactions with people; while such a personification may seem odd to some, for me it feels entirely natural.

The love of words and music have always been present in my life, but we haven't always gotten along very well. I have come to understand that there is a crucial difference between a love you profess and a love you inhabit. The loves we profess, too easily we postpone them and place them on pedestals; they become what we will attend to when we have time, or when the circumstances are right. We love them so much that we feel unprepared for or unworthy of them now.

An inhabited love is different. The loves we inhabit are not vulnerable to being sullied by imperfection, haste, or foul weather (of the mood or meteorological varieties). We can come in from the rain and wipe our muddy shoes on these loves; like a doormat, they mark the entrance to our homely spaces, ready to receive us however we arrive. Below our feet as they are, though, we often forget to realize the gift that is the ground. It is easy to feel outdone by the possibilities whirling around our eyes.

Such freedom of opportunity I have always enjoyed. I was raised in the spirit of self-determination, and in the fortunate circumstances that render that premise more than an empty promise. But this autonomy is different than the freedom of self-permission, a willingness that often eludes even those (like myself) of considerable privilege.

Amidst all these advantages I forgot how to be willing to do what I loved, and gradually I almost forgot that I loved it. I decided I would love instead what the world told me I was good at, in the hopes that I could become one of those enviable people who loved her job. I was practical, restrained, reasonable.

And suddenly I was all alone. This "world" was something I had imagined; it was merely the reified echo of the institutions that had formed my intellect. Like a bus, this so-called world could take me across town, but it couldn't provide a motivation for the trip. I got off because it was the end of the line, still lacking a destination.
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
Looking down at my feet, then, these last six months, I finally stared in the face the difference between being able to do what I love and being free to do so.

Doing what you love is not the same as getting what you want, or even doing what you want. Getting what you want is about power and control, whereas doing what you love requires you to surrender both. Doing what you want is about willfulness, which often sabotages rather than encourages the willingness we need to do what we love. It is a cop-out in the place of an opt-in.

I used to think that doing what I loved required drawing a line in the sand, a new point of departure after which everything would be different. I wanted to change myself in the hopes that I could be more creative, not recognizing that it was creative practice that would be the source, rather than the result, of change.

I'd be lying if I claimed that all circumstances are equally conducive to creative activity; nevertheless, I no longer believe that one's ideal circumstances have to be realized in advance of creative effort. While devoting all of one's time to art is circumstantial, and remains a luxury few of us have for long (if at all), devoting oneself to what one loves does not require a blank slate or an empty calendar. The best art is interstitial, filling in all of life's cracks, expanding into the various chasms in our hearts and minds, those fashioned by wonder as well as woe, etched by the delights as well as the disappointments of this mad, mad world.

I don't have a plan for 2012. I'm looking forward to it.
