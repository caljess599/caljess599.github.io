_The prior posts appeared on a blog that was hosted at www.lightthetunnel.net, whose motto was "If you can't find the end, light the tunnel"._

_Having ported the work I did on the blog that I feel withstands the judgment of hindsight (the poetry didn't make the cut), it doesn't seem like all that much material. And yet in my memory of those years, the blog loomed large. It was a great effort, and great comfort to me._

_All such efforts cannot be sustained indefinitely. But also my enthusiasm for writing publicly was beginning to flag. It wasn't just the one-sideness of writing a blog that no one read, but the sense of unnecessary exposure. The Internet was changing, becoming less and less defensible as a safe and reasonable space._ 

_You can't see it anymore, but after this pause, I started again, with a new look. I got a professional to design a truly sweet theme. Even in the face of Trump's election, I tried to honor my renewed commitment. It honestly wasn't going that well—and then my Wordpress blog got hacked. The Internet really isn't a safe place._

_At that point, I realized I didn't want to worry anymore about platforms and themes. I wanted something easy and free. And so that's why I've spent the time to reincarnate it all here, because it doesn't "git" much easier than this..._
