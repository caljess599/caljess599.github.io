> We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other â€“ through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security â€“ these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great. —President Barack H. Obama, [_Second Inaugural Address_](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/01/22/us/politics/22obama-inaugural-speech-annotated.html?ref=politics#/?annotation=b85fa54df)

### Just Happy to See Me
[A recent NRA video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqrwkiyPsto) aimed to stoke the flames of its supporters asks the following question: "Are the President's kids more important than yours?"

If you are an NRA supporter, you're apparently likely to answer "no." In which case, what follows will likely upset you:

<!--more-->
> Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. But, he's just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security. Protection for their kids... and gun-free zones for ours.

I have to confess that I'm amazed that this ad can manage to construe the term "gun-free zone" as a _negative_—and do so in well under a minute. And yet, there are plenty of other circumstances in which I'm more than willing to take the same attitude from which this portrayal stems: the one that says that quite often, the law (or the rules) are applied with a foolish inequality. For example, this is precisely how I feel when I'm taking my shoes off and my bagged liquids out at the airport — I'm not, nor are any of my fellow travelers, terrorists, and yet here we are, wasting time and money being presumed as such until panned and scanned. (Spreading my legs and raising my arms in that scanner, the pose struck me as an odd combination of criminal and stripper — neither role one I'd previously associated with air travel.)

Anyway, keeping that frustration in mind, one can (perhaps) understand the attitude of Suzanna Hupp, a survivor of a gun masacre in 1991 in Killeen, Texas. Not only did Ms. Hupp lose both of her parents at the hands of the gunman, George Jo Hennard, she lives everyday with the feeling that, if it hadn't been for her reluctance to break the law, she might have stopped him. She recounts to Robin Young on [NPR's _Here and Now_](http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/01/22/suzanna-hupp-guns) her thoughts as the gunman broke through the ceiling-to-floor window of Luby's Cafeteria and then started shooting.

> We were waiting for some sort of an explanation, like "Everyone put your wallets up on the table" or something along those lines. Remember, these shootings weren't happening in a random way back then. [...] It took a good 45 seconds for me to realize that this guy was just going to walk around and execute people. [...] And when I did realize it, I thought, "I've got him, I've got this guy."

> Robin Young: And you thought that because what?

> Because for several years I carried a gun in my purse, at that time illegally in the state of Texas. I had a patient when I was in Houston who was an Assistant DA, and he actually convinced me to carry one illegally. So I figured, 'I've got this guy.' But then I realized a few months earlier, I had made one of the stupidest decisions of my life. My gun was out in my car, 100 yards away, completely useless to me, because I'd wanted to obey the law. I figured, what are the odds of my needing a gun in a crowded place in the middle of the day?

Had Ms. Hupp been fortunate enough to spend her life on the good side of those odds, she might have figured a law that makes it illegal to carry weapons in most public places indeed makes sense. But one can easily see why that afternoon had the effect it did, and turned her against the law: "The only thing the law did," she explains to Ms. Young, "was prevent _me_ from being able to carry a weapon to protect myself. And as time went on, I found out that there were a dozen other people in there who had weapons out in the car, and had they been allowed to carry them in, might still be alive today."

Although some would argue that the presence of other armed people may not have necessarily improved the outcome, certainly the image of up to a dozen folks drawing their guns does alter the scenario, and maybe reduce the carnage. Certainly Ms. Hupp is accurate in her assessment of the effect of a gun in one man's hands in the middle of a room: "he has complete control over the situation." As she describes how her father attempted to rush the gunman and was shot and killed in so doing, she makes a convincing case for the idea that, truly, the only remedy for a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with one, too. Indeed, when police arrived, a shot to the ceiling was enough to scare the shooter toward a back bathroom area, where, after a brief exchange of fire between him and the officers, he put a bullet in his own head.

If the now-familiar shooting spree is indeed not about robbery or revenge, but truly about the a mad rush of powerfulness that such killing apparently supplies to the shooter, Ms. Hupp's strategy is to deprive the would-be shooter of the dominance that secures his thrill. "What angers me," she says, "is that these creeps always go where they know they can shoot people like fish in a barrel." In short, these rampagers are counting on — and taking devastating advantage of — the tendency of people to obey the law not to carry guns to the mall, to school, to church, etc.

As long as this fact remains true, it will always be open season on Americans, wherever and whenever. Indeed, Ms. Hupp accepts the horrid deaths of her parents with a fierce stoicism, her anger directed not at the shooter but at the law. To be angry at the shooter, she said, "would be like being angry at a rabid dog."  I suppose it goes without saying that one doesn't get angry at a rabid dog—or, for that matter, as a liberal might, stand around discussing what in its upbringing caused it to veer off the course of normal, socially-responsible dog life, and then why it was legally allowed to order that Uzi off the Internet. One just shoots it.

### Roe, Roe, Roe Your Boat
Tuesday marked the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in _Roe v. Wade_ that legalized abortion nationwide (by overturning as unconstitutional Texas's criminal abortion statute). If the initial impetus toward decriminalizing abortion came in large part from the medical establishment, it is the political sphere that has taken the issue to the forefront of American minds in the intervening decades. [Blame Nixon] (http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/01/22/169637288/roe-v-wade-turns-40-but-abortion-debate-is-even-older?ft=1&amp;f=1070): in 1972, he was advised by his strategists to come out against abortion in a bid to lure northern Catholic voters to the Republican side—despite the fact that Republicans (including Nixon himself) had previously been more in favor of abortion rights than Democrats.

Fast forward to 2013, and you see the Texas legislature's [latest ventures in pro-childbirth policies](http://www.texasobserver.org/pregnant-scared-can-they-help/). (Really, the idea that you can't be in favor of 'life' when you favor the right to let women decide to terminate a pregnancy reduces the notion of life to just that of making babies — and while babies are cute and all, they are not the sum total of life. So let's call being against abortion what it really is: being pro-childbirth.) In addition to passing a sonogram requirement and a 24-hour-wait law for women seeking termination, it now funds (to the tune of $4.15 million in taxpayer money) crisis pregnancy centers: non-medical facilities that provide Christian-based (and -biased) materials to push abstinence as birth control and to persuade women to choose parenthood or adoption over abortion. Indeed, they are contracted by the state to do the latter under the state's Alternatives To Abortion Program, an initiative modelled on a similar one in Pennsylvania.

There are certainly plenty of circumstances in which the state may decide to have a vested interest in promoting childbirth; falling birthrates and the resulting skewed demographics are a significant worry of Japan, Germany, and other countries. What is curious in the Texas situation is that such a demographic interest is absent, and yet the promotion of childbirth seems to have replaced the supposed original goal of reducing the number of abortions performed — a goal with which even pro-choice advocates feel comfortable (recall the "safe, legal, and rare" motto of the Clinton presidency). And yet, these crisis pregnancy centers pointedly eschew the most obvious way to lower the demand for abortion: lowering the rate of unwanted pregnancies. Which, _pace_ the religious right, is not achieved by talking up chastity but by making birth control freely and widely available. (You ever hear that joke about how if men got pregnant, birth control would be in the water supply, like floride?)

In [an op-ed piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/leeches-lye-and-spanish-fly.html) in _The New York Times_, author Kate Manning describes the historical methods that women have used to terminate their pregnancies, usually alone, and usually at considerable risk to themselves. She draws an important lesson from this consistent "willingness" to attempt abortion:

> Women's historical willingness to endure horrible dangers, to submit to extreme and prolonged pain, to risk grave injury and death rather than remain pregnant, tells us something important about female desperation and determination, and the price women were—and still are—willing to pay to control their own bodies. What it tells us is that women will always find ways to end an unwanted pregnancy, no matter what the law says, no matter the risks to themselves.

It is interesting to consider the abortion question from the standpoint of control, as opposed to, say, the standpoint of consequences. In previous centuries, a pregnancy might well carry other burdens in addition to the child: it was proof of sexual activity, which itself constituted, in many historical contexts, immoral conduct. (In certain places in the world today, it still does.) But this American age of the crisis pregnancy center is a far cry from the young, unwed women sent away to deliver babies in secret: now, when [a thirteen-year-old](http://www.texasobserver.org/pregnant-scared-can-they-help/) shows up in Abilene, Texas, she's blithely told that she's already a mommy, and that adoption is the most unselfish thing she could ever do for her child. Although she'll be encouraged to remain abstinent if she wants to avoid future unplanned pregnancies (it's 100% effective, you know), she'll never be told that she's a slut or a sinner for having a baby before she's old enough to legally drive. And while I don't want her to be told she's either, I do want her to be told that she can have sex without the risk of pregnancy. I can understand why abortion opponents believe in preventing each and every abortion; they are, in their minds, saving a life and preventing the commission of a grave sin. But what I cannot understand is why this compassion stops short of counseling a clearly sexually active teenager about birth control: what possible goal, other than the promotion of the extreme view that all non-procreative sex is immoral, is served by increasing the likelihood that this teenage mom will once again become pregnant?

Perhaps it is difficult for decidedly pro-childbirth people to imagine the enduring vehemence with which many women, in all centuries, have decided, for whatever individual reasons, against the desirability of bearing a particular child at a particular time. But if what Ms. Manning suggests is true — and it seems indeed reasonable — then we must come to terms with the fact that the concept of the unwanted pregnancy is as real and valid as its counterpart: the planned and much-hoped-for birth. Ms. Manning posits abortion as an age-old solution to a timeless female experience, arguing that a woman's impulse to control her reproductivity has existed — and will exist — regardless of the law, just as her urge to bear children and raise a family will also surely continue.

### Write to Life
A recent Pew Forum poll](http://www.pewforum.org/Abortion/roe-v-wade-at-40.aspx)reports that American public opinion on this issue has not shifted significantly in the the last twenty years; over that time, support for maintaining the legal situation established by _Roe_ remains around 60%. If anything, what has changed over this time is the awareness of the court decision itself as a landmark in the abortion debate: less than half (44%) of the under 30 crowd polled correctly associated _Roe v. Wade_ with the issue of abortion (33% of respondents answered incorrectly, 24% did not know). This forgetting of the prehistory of _Roe_ has potentially dangerous consequences: many people who are, for entirely legitimate reasons, opposed to abortion, may not realize the physical harm that came to women who, before legalization, sought the procedure or attempted it upon themselves. Indeed, the pro-life movement is rather disingenuous in overlooking this history, considering that a key aspect of their current argument against abortion is [the (medically inaccurate) positing of physical and psychological harm](http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/myths/index.html) as a result of abortion. Here's an exchange on [the PBS Newshour](http://video.pbs.org/video/2328133365)between Nancy Keenan of NARAL Pro-Choice America and Charmaine Yoest of Americans United for Life.

> KEENAN: [50:40] Women think about this. They understand the complexity of it. They know what their decision is because it's their life, their story. And I think that's where the disconnect is: who do you trust? who decides? There's the million dollar question: who decides — does she or the government.

> YOEST: [50:55] Women feel betrayed by an abortion industry that has put money and profits over women's health. There are over a dozen clinics that are being investigated today across this country for unsafe, unsanitary conditions, and the abortion lobby does everything they can, everything they can, to keep from having common-sense regulations put in place. We regulate veterinary clinics better than we do abortion clinics in this country, and that's outrageous. That is not serving American women, and American women are the ones who are speaking up and saying "enough".

While I do not doubt that there are women who have lived to regret their abortions, it is due to the legalization that more of them _do_ live instead of dying in back alleys or kitchen tables from coat-hanger abortions. Yoest's implication that _Roe_ has betrayed women and has created an unregulated "industry" is, frankly, laughable. Not only does such talk obscure the point that her organization is against abortion, period, no matter how safe or regulated, it also posits women as mere victims of some unspecified force that promotes abortions, rather than as individuals who want to, and do, make that decision and take the responsibility for it.

As the handful of people who read my blog know, I spend an inordinate amount of time exploring the strange and tenuous connections in my mind between things that, on the surface, don't suggest themselves as related. In this case, what fascinated me is the notion of responsibility within these two narratives sketched above by Ms. Hupp and Ms. Yoest. In the first case, Ms. Hupp's comparison of the shooter Mr. Hennard to a rabid dog deprives him of all moral agency, and shifts the moral emphasis to her own status as a defenseless victim. What this shift regrettably short circuits is the social consideration that typically follows questions of immoral behavior by people: the fact that we might use regulation to possibly keep guns out of his hands or provide mental health care to possibly discourage his crime. In the second case, Ms. Yoest would rather cast women who abort as victims of "industry," rather than confront the fact that there are (and have always been) women who really do want to—and do—end their pregnancies without serious moral qualm or significant regret. They are choosing, unapologetically, a what nearly a majority of Americans (47%) view, for themselves personally anyway, as [a morally reprehensible action](http://www.pewforum.org/Abortion/roe-v-wade-at-40.aspx). To not consider the validity of female agency in this decision is to remain unable to address it properly from a public health perspective, simply because what one believes for oneself is not, nor has even been, a sufficient means for determining the rules under which a given society will live.

I am very much aware here that the discussion of these two issues in close conjunction abuts a very slippery slope; many would be only too ready to see in my own argument an implied comparison between women who abort and rampage killers. I want to be clear, however, that my interest in this case is not to perform a moral analysis of any sort. Indeed, my interest is not really political at all, but creative, and in the creative consequences for narratives whose authors and/or characters have difficulty confronting the notion of responsibility in problematic contexts—which, let's be honest, are really the only kinds of contexts in which it is worthwhile to tell stories.

In his essay "Dysfunctional Narratives: or: 'Mistakes Were Made," [Charles Baxter](http://www.amazon.com/Burning-Down-House-Essays-Fiction/dp/1555975089/) blames none other than Richard Nixon for inaugurating an era of responsibility-avoiding discourse, a cultural of disavowal.

> We have been living in a political culture of disavowals. Disavowals follow from crimes for which no one is capable of claiming responsibility. Mistakes and crimes tend to create narratives, however, and they have done so from the time of Greek tragedies. How can the contemporary disavowal movement not affect those of us who tell stories? We begin to move away from fiction of protagonists and antagonists into another mode, another model. It is hard to describe this model but I think it might be called the fiction of finger-pointing, the fiction of the quest for blame. It often culminates with a scene in a court of law.

> In such fiction, people and events are often accused of turning the protagonist into the kind of person the protagonist is, usually an unhappy person. That's the whole story. When blame has been assigned, the story is over. [...] Look at _Montel Williams_, or _Oprah._... For all the variety of the situations, the unwritten scripts are often similar.  Someone is testifying because s/he's been hurt by someone else. The pain-inflicter is invariably present and accounted for onstage, and sometimes this person admits, abashedly, to inflicting the ruin: cheating, leaving, abusing, or murdering. Usually, however, there's no remorse or shame. Some other factor caused it: bad genes, alcoholism, drugs, or—the cause of last resort—Satan.... The dramatis personae... generally will not say that they did what they did because they wanted to, or because they had _decided_ to do it. The story is shocking. You hear gasps. But the participants are as baffled and as bewildered as everyone else. So we have the spectacle of utterly perplexed villains deprived of their villainy. Villainy, properly understood, gives someone a largeness, a sense of scale. It seems to me that this sense of scale has probably abandoned us.

Mr. Baxter writes about craft in a way I never thought possible until I read him; but when he sums up his interest as "issues that in the broadest sense have to do with the imagination's grip on daily life," I suddenly understood that my blog has always been more to me than a repetitive liberal screed, obsessing about the issues of same-sex marriage, abortion, and violence in society. Always, and now more than ever, it is my own attempt to work out the relationship between this present American moment and my own imaginative work.

There are probably writers who simply write, who take the story and run, but I am (apparently) a writer who needs also to write about writing, and to wonder about the function of creativity in public and private contexts. It is my goal to write more, and to write better, but I also want to write more knowingly, more conscious of the possibilities of different ways of writing, and how those possibilities relate to this historical-imaginative moment, and my own position in it. The pot of gold is the stories, but the exploration of my imagination is the rainbow.
