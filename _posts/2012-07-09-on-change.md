> Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has long ago approved what you do. [...] Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to the skillful; but time and chance happen to them all. For no one can anticipate the time of disaster. —Ecclesiastes 9:7, 11-12</p>

### Stormy weather
I shouldn't brag, but I have power. Electric power. Many in central Virginia still do not, even nearly a week after a rare type of storm, a derecho (from the Spanish "straight ahead"), hit this area last Friday evening. And as many people in the surrounding counties draw their water from wells, no power also means no water. And did I mention that we're having the hottest weather of the summer so far? In short, it's a mess of discomfort, damage, and for [11 unfortunate VA residents](http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/Va_Storm_Death_Toll_Rises_to_11_161248715.html), death.

As these events tend to remind us, forewarned does not necessarily inspire us to be forearmed. If you were watching TV or listening to the radio that evening, you would have undoubtedly received the weather warning. But at that point, it may have been too late to do those simple-but-essential preparatory things: fill your gas tank; refresh your emergency supplies, especially water; get your hands on a battery-powered radio and flashlight.

It is not simple ignorance that promotes unpreparedness—anyone who has lived through one east coast summer (or winter) knows that power outages are a seasonal inevitability. Rather, it is our collective blithe spiritedness, our reliance to the point of forgetfulness on the infrastructure of modern America, that leaves us a bit surprised each time the inevitable occurs.

And so we pause. And sweat. The neighborhood men gather and fire up the chainsaws. We use our smart phones to tell everyone on our social networks that we don't have power. We talk to one another in the uncommon loudness of the breeze and bugs. We sleep in the basement. We lie awake in the moist darkness of the long, hot nights, and think about the options for the freezer: lose it all, or fight back with ice supplies. We go to work for the coolness, to the gym for a shower. We become refugees, off to a friend's house, whether in town or out of state. Gradually, we find the calm after the storm.

### Paper Moon
Before the derecho, the big storm in Cville was of another kind: [the massive fallout](http://www.readthehook.com/104355/ouster-aftermath-timeline-uva-tumult) after the unexpected forced resignation of the president of the University of Virginia, Teresa Sullivan. Out of the blue, Rector Helen Dragas (the head of the Board of Visitors) led a behind-the-scenes effort to secure the votes to oust Sullivan, who, when confronted (on Friday, June 8) by Dragas and (former) Vice-Rector Mark Kington, consented to their request that she resign.

Not since Helen of Troy has a woman of that name wrought so much trouble: from town to gown, everyone was shocked, and a lot of folks were outraged. The outpouring of anger at the Board and support for Sullivan gave a lie to the clichÃ© of a sleepy summer University campus. On the contrary, the Faculty Senate sprang into action, fueling the general impression that the only way out of this sudden mess was a U-turn. And despite the skepticism of some, that's exactly what happened; on June 26, in a special, live-streamed meeting of the Board of Visitors, all of them—including the by-now-vilified Dragas—[voted to reinstate Sullivan](http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/BREAKING_S_160420665.html). And for those of us who thought the televised love-fest that followed the meeting was just for show, the Governor announced this week that he was [appointing Dragas for a second four-year term](http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/Gov_McDonnell_Announces_UVa_Board_of_Visitors_Appointments_160873065.html) on the Board, something one assumes would not have happened if Sullivan had not given her okay.

The origin of this maelstrom was, Dragas claimed, a need for change—large-scale changes at the University that, in turn, required a change at the top. But as was plainly evident in the statement Dragas issued in an attempt at clarification, the items she listed—declining state funding, the constant struggle for revenue, the necessity of considering the final frontier of education, online instruction—[were no different than the challenges faced by any large public university](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/education/public-universities-see-familiar-fight-at-virginia.html). And nowhere was there any explanation about how the much-beloved Sullivan, in under two years at UVa, had demonstrated an unawareness of or inability to meet such challenges.

While it seems clear enough that the current model of accruing massive debt for an undergraduate degree is untenable in the long term, it seems even less likely that high-achieving business types are going to achieve a corporate miracle by hasty personnel change at the top. Sullivan has it right when she warned in [her own statement](http://www.nbc29.com/story/18817164/first-time-since-outser-sullivan-speaks) (post-resignation, pre-reinstatement): "Corporate-style, top-down leadership does not work in a great university. Sustained change with buy-in does work."

### Undecided
Nationally, the big story this week was the Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. For all the hullabaloo and made-for-cable drama of the Big Day of Decision, the majority ruling itself was fairly pedestrian: Congress is free to pass taxes, and so if Congress wants to assess a penalty tax on those who don't purchase health care, it's not for the Court to say otherwise. In short, as [section 4b of the majority opinion reads](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf):

> Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax. The payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penalties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by the IRS through the normal means of taxation. Cf. <em>Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co</em>., 259 U. S. 20, 36â€“37. None of this is to say that payment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance. But the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS. And Congress's choice of language — stating that individuals "shall" obtain insurance or pay a "penalty" — does not require reading §5000A as punishing unlawful conduct. It may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insurance. See _New York v. United States_, 505 U.S. 144, 169-174. Pp. 35-40.

What makes this perfectly reasonable argument so surprising is the fact that it is Chief Justice John Roberts's vote securing its status as the majority opinion. In other words, we are shocked that the same [mastermind behind the takedown of campaign finance law](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/21/120521fa_fact_toobin) would suddenly show such deference to the legislative branch.

Roberts is taking a lot of flak for his position in the majority from both sides of the aisle. The focus of criticism from the left had less to do with the Affordable Care Act itself and more with long-term implications of the narrow interpretation of the Commerce Clause, as [summarized by Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan](http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.4/pamela_s_karlan_supreme_court_obamacare_ruling.php):

> It has no effect in this particular case, because in this case the chief justice peeled away from that to sustain the act on taxing-power grounds. But it suggests that there are five justices who really do want to impose some limits on the commerce power, and, in a separate dissent, Justice Thomas repeated his belief that we should go back to the nineteenth-century version of commerce.

While the left may be worried about the future, the right is bitter about the present, a bitterness that is directed straight at the Chief Justice. In an [editorial](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303561504577496603068605864.html) in _The Wall Street Journal_, Roberts is labeled with the biggest insult of all to those who fancy the Court a bastion of above-the-fray cognition and sagacity: politician.

> Chief Justice Roberts has created a creature that is not a tax for political purposes but is a tax for constitutional purposes. [...] His ruling, with its multiple contradictions and inconsistencies, reads as if it were written by someone affronted by the government's core constitutional claims but who wanted to uphold the law anyway to avoid political blowback and thus found a pretext for doing so in the taxing power.

> If this understanding is correct, then Chief Justice Roberts behaved like a politician, which is more corrosive to the rule of law and the Court's legitimacy than any abuse it would have taken from a ruling that President Obama disliked. The irony is that the Chief Justice's cheering section is praising his political skills, not his reasoning. Judges are not supposed to invent political compromises.

The idea that the Court isn't mired in politics or compromise seems kind of silly to me—this idealization of judicial purity is the conservative pipe dream that corresponds perfectly to the left's belief that social change can (and should!) be initiated by a noble-minded judiciary. If the left errs in its naivety that men will be grateful for government's interference in the name of justice and/or betterment, the right errs in its conviction that the naked principles of liberty are enough to solve our problems.

While my eyes are increasingly open to the pitfalls of government-led solutions to economic and social woes, at least the left is attempting to grapple with the problem of health care availability. Reading the above editorial, one gets the sense that the authors have no sympathy with people who are unable to get health insurance—indeed, it rather seems that they are so consumed by issues of constitutional purity that the existence of such a problem entirely fails to register. In short, liberty is grand, but the best kind of liberty is the freedom _to_ do something about our difficulties, rather than permission to sit on our hands on the bench of the status quo.

### Let's call the whole thing off
The presidential candidacy of Romney is surely the canary-in-the-mine of our dangerous obsession with principles (and power) rather than practicalities. We already know the story of how a man who claimed to be more liberal than Ted Kennedy on gay rights and who, as governor of Massachusetts, signed health care reform that provided near-universal coverage via the provision of an individual mandate now claims to "severely conservative." We are either indifferent or cynical enough to recognize that these changes are to be expected in a system where there are only two options for seeking the highest office in the land: talk like a Democrat or talk like a Republican. Since the Democrat position was already occupied by the incumbent, Romney had no choice but to go to the right—and just how far right he had to go was not up to him, either, but was determined by the other candidates in the by-now-forgotten primary campaign.

Knowing all that, I don't think anyone counts on Romney to be a paragon of consistency. Indeed, it is as if the outbreak of flip-flop outrage against John Kerry way back in 2004 has inoculated the American public against calculatingly opinionated politicians. While Kerry's changeability went against his credibility, there seems to be an unspoken agreement among the supporters of Mitt Romney that no matter how many times the slate is blanked and rewritten—or the [Etch-A-Sketch shaken and re-doodled upon](http://www.etchasketchmittromney.com/)—Romney remains consistent where it counts, i.e., he is not Barack Obama.

This exceedingly low threshold for Romney's political viability goes a long way to explaining the candidate's most recent episode of foot-in-mouth disease in the wake of the Supreme Court decision on Obamacare. While his top aide Eric Fehrnstrom [said on July 2](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/us/politics/romney-says-health-care-mandate-is-a-tax.html) that Romney did not believe the penalty (for not complying with the mandate to purchase health insurance) was a tax, by July 4, [Romney felt the need](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7413844n) to state publicly that he accepted the ruling of the Supreme Court, and that, because the Supreme Court said so, the penalty must indeed be a tax.

This really got on some conservative nerves. The Supreme Court decision was bad enough, but Mitt Romney's reaction to it was adding injury to insult. _The Wall Street Journal_ excoriated Romney for not jumping on the "it's a tax" bandwagon and using it to accuse Obama of the ultimate swing-voter sin: raising taxes on the middle class. (Never mind, of course, that this group might include the very folks who would appreciate being able to purchase health insurance.)

> Mr. Romney should use the Supreme Court opinion as an opening to say that now that the mandate is defined as a tax for the purposes of the law, he will work to repeal it. <em>[...] </em>

> Democrats would point to the Massachusetts record, but Mr. Romney could reply that was before the Supreme Court had spoken, that he had promised Bay Staters not to raise taxes, and so now the right policy is to repeal the tax along with the rest of ObamaCare. The tragedy is that for the sake of not abandoning his faulty health-care legacy in Massachusetts, Mr. Romney is jeopardizing his chance at becoming President.

> Perhaps Mr. Romney is slowly figuring this out, because in a July 4 interview he stated himself that the penalty now is a "tax" after all. But he offered no elaboration, and so the campaign looks confused in addition to being politically dumb.

Those are harsh words for the only man standing between them and four more years of Obama. But as dumb as Romney may look, the advice the editorial is doling out seems even dumber. Romney, who was up until the decision itself, convinced that the mandate was unconstitutional, is now supposed to a) embrace the constitutionality of the mandate but then b) conclude that because it is constitutional _as a tax_, it is therefore bad policy—because, of course, the primary definition of a conservative is to be against taxes.

Even if Romney hadn't been _for_ the mandate when a) he was governor; b) the mandate was that of a state; and c) he called it a penalty, this reversal would be tricky—and largely unnecessary. I mean, if four of the Supreme Court Justices don't think the mandate can be constitutionally construed as a tax, why is it so important that Romney express his willingness to go along with the majority opinion? Why couldn't he say something like: "I am more convinced by the arguments of the dissenting opinions, but given that Congress could repeal the law, it is of little consequence that it has been allowed to stand on the constitutional grounds that it is a tax."

But of course the reason Romney—or anyone else on the right—hasn't done this is because it is (and remains) much easier to grandstand against the law on trumped-up violations of principles than objections to its policies. While the battle to paint Obamacare as a terrifying expansion of government's powers of compulsion has been lost, the troops are falling back on the familiar anti-tax ramparts. But the cry is the same: the Affordable Care Act is a bad law, and it's very unpopular. But as people who like the idea that Obama indeed does care about the issue of health insurance are quick to chime in, when asked about the things that the law would do—abolish rules regarding pre-existing conditions, set up exchanges to make it easier and cheaper to by insurance, abolish lifetime caps on coverage—people are overwhelming in favor of those policies.

Romney should have taken the opportunity to review the [Declaration of Independence](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/us/a-clearer-facsimile-of-the-declaration-of-independence.html) this July 4—while it is imbued with a recognizably American ideological cockiness that has marked our Union since the beginning, it is also a list of very specific policy grievances that are about how people live, not just the principles (invoked imperfectly, as we well know) that should guide the redress of those wrongs. To the extent that the supporters of Obamacare want to get something done—or at least try—it is they who are the inheritors of the mantle of freedom and liberty so eloquently and daringly penned 236 years ago this week.
