title: "On A Room of One's Own"
---

> Come back soon, you've been damn brave. —Said to Alice, leaving the bookstore

Between the walk into town, the chaos of a labyrinthine bookstore, the crowded vastness of a University library's stacks, and the drenching of a summer thunderstorm, a whole day can be spent in the acquisition of books and the completion, at last in dryness, of one slim volume trudged home. <!--more--> While unlike the magical purse of Mary Beton, my checkbook will not "breed ten-shilling notes automatically" for life, for the time being, I am enjoying the creative freedom Woolf summarized in October 1929 by the material things that would have then made it possible for women: money (£500 a year, not in salary, but as income) and private, physical space (the room of one's own). And so it seemed fitting to turn back to this essay, to reflect in gratitude for the possibilities of this present time.

### An open sky
_A Room of One's Own_, like many useful books, is of its own time and also timeless. I almost laugh while reading of women being denied access to the library at Oxbridge (lacking the company of a fellow of the College or a letter of introduction), and doing without the lush amenities, gastronomic and residential, provided by the largess of the richer (male) institutions. How different is the state of higher education today, particularly in America, where women not only attend the Ivy League Institutions, but also have decisively [outnumbered men in terms of college attendance](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/01/26/gender) for over 10 years now. But it is a wry laughter, for although the balance of access has shifted, at the same time the game has changed, and as the saying goes, the more things change, the more they remain the same. Women, despite going from total exclusion to (at least) demographic dominance in the academy, do not seem to have gained an advantage from this shift. Don't get me wrong -- I don't mean to say that for the women who have received educational access, including myself, that there is no difference between then and now. Of course there is. But as a group, it seems, women still suffer distinct disadvantages, despite have gone from under- to overrepresented in institutions of higher education. For instance, it can actually be [_easier_ for boys to get into college these days](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/03/27/admit), because they are considered a desirable quantity, a coveted _minority._ Off campus, and overall, women are still the minority-that-is-not-one that we have always been. Meaning we are not a minority (constituting as we do 50% or more of the population) and that the historical (and present) discrimination against us (by women _and_ men) has nothing to do with percentages but with power. Discrimination can just as easily occur against the majority, as in the case of apartheid in South Africa and in many countries today where the rulers belong to a distinct group (ethnic, religious, tribal, what have you) than the population they rule. But I digress. Point is, [women still earn 77 cents on the male dollar](http://www.iwpr.org/initiatives/pay-equity-and-discrimination/#about), and we are significantly underrepresented in positions of power, whether that be in the halls of government, military, business, or academia. Although Woolf is not here to wax elegantly satirical about the current state of affairs, she has already identified the true problem, and provided the solution. The solution, for the woman who would write, is not to be angry at the world that has limited her opportunities, and it is financial and physical freedom that can assuage this bitterness. Mary Benton describes her emotional transition from working woman to independent writer upon receiving her windfall. (Ellipses and paragraphing are mine.)

> I need not, I am afraid, describe in any detail the hardness of the work ...; nor the difficulty of living on the money when it was earned... But what still remains with me as a worse infliction than either was the poison of fear and bitterness which which those days bred in me. To begin with, always to be doing work that one did not wish to do, and to do it like a slave, flattering and fawning, not always necessarily perhaps, but it seemed necessary and the stakes were too great to run risks; and the thought of that one gift which it was death to hide... perishing and with it myself, my soul -- all this became like rust eating away the bloom of the spring, destroying the tree at its heart. However, as I say, my aunt died; and whenever I change a ten-shilling note a little of that rust and corrosion is rubbed off; fear and bitterness go... Therefore not merely do effort and labour cease, but also hatred and bitterness. I need not hate any man; he cannot hurt me. I need not flatter any man; he has nothing to give me. So imperceptibly I found myself adopting a new attitude towards the other half of the human race. It was absurd to blame any class or any sex, as a whole. Great bodies of people are never responsible for what they do.... They too, the patriarchs, the professors, had endless difficulties, terrible drawbacks to contend with.... True, they had money and power, but only at the cost of harbouring in their breasts an eagle, a vulture... the instinct for possession, the rage for acquisition which drives them to desire other people's fields and goods perpetually... These are unpleasant instincts to harbour, I reflected... And, as I realized these drawbacks, by degrees fear and bitterness modified themselves into pity and toleration; and then in a year or two, pity and toleration went, and the greatest release of all came, which is freedom to think of things in themselves. That building, for example, do I like it or not? Is that picture beautiful or not? Is that in my opinion a good book or a bad? Indeed my aunt's legacy unveiled the sky to me, and substituted for the large and imposing figure of a gentleman, which Milton recommended for my perpetual adoration, a view of the open sky.

### Behind Bars
Recently, I have read Michelle Alexander's _[The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness](http://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595581030/)._ While this book is certainly not the first to address the issue of the exploding prison population in recent decades or its disproportionate impact on non-white men ("black and brown" is the term Alexander frequently uses), it promulgates an original and provocative thesis that this imprisonment constitutes the latest form of race-based social control, following slavery and Jim Crow. While I believe that mass incarceration is a disgrace of our society, and all the more so because of its disproportional destruction of the lives, liberties, and pursuits of public happiness of racial minorities, it turns out that imprisonment is only one part of the story of confinement in America, and that when you consider asylums and mental institutions, you understand that institutionalization has long been a part of our social system. From the abstract of [Bernard E. Harcourt](http://bernardharcourt.com/)’s 2006 article “[From the Asylum to the Prison: Rethinking the Incarceration Revolution](http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/institutionalized-final.pdf)”:

> When the data on mental hospitalizations rates are combined with the data on imprisonment rates for the period 1928 through 2000, the incarceration revolution of the late twentieth century barely reaches the level of aggregated institutionalization that the United States experienced at mid-century. The highest rate of aggregated institutionalization during the entire period occurred in 1955 when almost 640 persons per 100,000 adults over age 15 were institutionalized in asylums, mental hospitals, and state and federal prisons. (p. 1751)

If you have access to JSTOR, you can read the [latest edition of Harcourt’s research](http://www.jstor.org/pss/10.1086/658404), where he discovers to have actually underestimated these figures, and concludes that “the aggregated institutionalization rates (in all mental hospitals and prisons) between 1936 and 1963 consistently exceeded 700 persons per 100,000 adults” with peaks of 760 in 1955, 757 in 1954, and 756 in 1948 (p. 6-7).\] The main difference then, between confinement then and now, is not the tendency to confine, but the demographics of the institutionalized population. As [Harcourt explains in an op-ed piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/15/opinion/15harcourt.html) in the New York Times from 2007:

> In 1937, women represented 48 percent of residents in state mental hospitals. In contrast, new prison admissions have consistently been 95 percent male. Also, the mental health patients from the 1930s to the 1960s were older and whiter than prison inmates of the 1990s. But the graph poses a number of troubling questions: Why did we diagnose deviance in such radically different ways over the course of the 20th century? Do we need to be imprisoning at such high rates, or were we right, 50 years ago, to hospitalize instead? Why were so many women hospitalized? Why have they been replaced by young black men? Have both prisons and mental hospitals included large numbers of unnecessarily incarcerated individuals? Whatever the answers, the pendulum has swung too far — possibly off its hinges.

### A Class Action

Which brings me to Wal-Mart. Last week, the court issued its [decision](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-277.pdf) rejecting the formation of a nationwide class of 1.5 million female employees of Wal-Mart for the purposes of a class action lawsuit contending sex-based discrimination in promotion and pay practices. While the Court did not rule on the merits of the discrimination case itself -- i.e., it did not issue a finding about the existence of discriminatory practices at Wal-Mart -- the majority (5-4, with the three female justices on the Court joining the minority dissent) decision has the effect of making it much more difficult for women to sue Wal-Mart over discriminatory practices. As can well be imagined, the inability to sue as a nationwide class will diminish the chances that any lawsuits will be brought, given that it takes huge resources to sue a giant corporation such as Wal-Mart, and that, absent the class action status, firms will no longer be motivated by the potentially large legal fee awards to accept such cases on contingency. The formation of a legal "class" in federal court is governed by the [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23](http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm). Section (a) establishes the necessary prerequisites to establishing a class:

> One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

Scalia, writing for the majority, focused on the second of these prerequisites, ruling that the respondents had failed to demonstrate that the grievances they identified in their individual cases were applicable to all female employees. In order to qualify as a class for the purposes of legal action, the plaintiffs must bridge the "conceptual gap" between an individual's experience and a general standard of treatment. The Court found that they had failed to do so:

> The second manner of bridging the gap requires "significant proof " that Wal-Mart "operated under a general policy of discrimination."  That is entirely absent here. Wal-Mart's announced policy forbids sex discrimination... The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs' evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-Mart's "policy" of _allowing discretion_ by local supervisors over employment matters. On its face, of course, that is just the opposite of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action; it is a policy _against having_ uniform employment practices.

The Court does not rule out the possibility of a possible discrimination claim in an environment of local discretion, but rather rules that the plaintiffs have not proven that it exists in the Walmart instance:

> But the recognition that this type of Title VII claim "can" exist does not lead to the conclusion that every employee in a company using a system of discretion has such a claim in common.  To the contrary, left to their own devices most managers in any corporation and **surely** most managers in a corporation that forbids sex discrimination would select sex-neutral, performance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no **actionable disparity** at all. (Boldface mine.)

Surely. Surely? Why is Scalia so sure? Why is he so sure that, in an organization where women fill 70% of the hourly jobs and only 33% of managerial positions, that, even if sex discrimination in promotion does occur, _it is not going to be prevalent enough_ to produce the kind of disparity that is entitled _to even petition_ for relief as a class. It is this sureness to which Justice Ginsburg objects to in her dissent (joined by Justices Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), in which she draws attention to the word "question" in Rule 23(a)(2).

> A "question" is ordinarily understood to be "\[a\] subject or point open to controversy."  American Heritage Dictionary 1483 (3d ed. 1992).  See also Black's Law Dictionary 1366 (9th  ed. 2009) (defining "question of  fact" as "\[a\] disputed issue to be resolved ... \[at\] trial" and "question of law" as "\[a\]n issue to be decided  by the judge").  Thus,  a "question" "common to the class" must be a dispute, either of fact or of law, the resolution of which will advance the determination of the class members' claims.

In short, Ginsburg believes that the majority has misinterpreted the prerequisite of commonality, setting the threshold too high.

> The plaintiffs' allegations state claims of gender discrimination in the form of biased decision making in both pay and promotions.  The evidence reviewed by the District Court adequately demonstrated that resolving those claims would necessitate examination of particular policies and practices alleged to affect, adversely and globally, women employed at Wal-Mart's stores.  Rule 23(a)(2), setting a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for class action certification, demands nothing further.

The question she wishes to allowed to be asked, Scalia has already answered. By the ruling, Ginsburg writes, "\[t\]he Court disqualifies the class at the starting gate."

### The (Looking) Glass Ceiling

Fundamentally, the difference between Scalia and Ginsburg's opinions is the willingness to examine the relationship between a policy and a reality, between opportunity on paper and opportunity in daily life. The majority's confidence that Wal-Mart's policies -- _despite_ uncontested evidence of widespread pay differences between men and women, and the latter's underrepresentation in higher-level positions -- are not legally challengeable by women as a class throws us back upon our regrettable status as the minority-that-is-not-one. We have been let into the library, the electorate, the workforce, the boardroom... so, he says, how can you say that you are not equal if we say you are no longer lesser?

> But... may I remind you that there have been at least two colleges for women in existence in England since the year 1866; that after the year 1880 a married woman was allowed by law to possess her own property; and that in 1919 -- which is a whole nine years ago -- she was given a vote? May I also remind you that the _\[sic\]_ most of the professions have been open to you for close on ten years now? When you reflect upon these immense privileges and the length of time during which they have been enjoyed, and the fact that there must be at this moment some two thousand women capable of earning over five hundred a year in one way or another, you will agree that the excuse of lack of opportunity, training, encouragement, leisure and money no longer holds good.

Woolf is, of course, waxing satirical, giving preemptive voice to the male criticism she feels her suggestions in _A Room of One's Own_ will prompt. Scalia, however, is not satirical at all. And were [$31,900](http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/exchange/result_exchall.php?action=&iyear=1929&dyear=2008&ivalue=500&itype=pound) a year for life to appear magically in my bank account, in all of our bank accounts, like Mary Seton, I would not be bitter, I would not be concerned. But because it isn't going to, I am bitter, I am concerned. I must be -- we must be.
