> The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt — a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the Lord. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. No longer shall they teach one another, or say to one another, "Know the Lord," for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more. 
#### —Jeremiah 31:31-34

### Back to School
Fall is in the air, and the coolness after a fairly lush summer make for a gloriously verdant few weeks, a miraculous interregnum between the miserable humidity of August and the changing colors and darker days of full-blown autumn.

Although I still teach on the semester schedule that has regulated the majority of my years, it no longer has the same internal pull that it once did. After many years of the academic lifestyle, work knows no season for me now. Thus the association between fall and renewal now comes more from the Jewish New Year and the refreshing break in East Coast summer heat.

This fall also marks an important juncture in a project I understood at the beginning of this calendar year: the reading of the entire Holy Bible. The Jewish Bible (even minus the Apocrypha) is so much longer than what Christians call the New Testament that, in a year's reading, you don't even come to the Gospels until the final day of September.

Quite frankly, I have been entirely underwhelmed by my reading of the Bible so far. I've committed to doing it because I feel that it is unconscionable to be as "educated" as I am and _not_ have read the Bible, but I can't say that I've gotten very much out of this initial encounter. The Jewish Bible is an easy book to read, but a very difficult book to understand. It is from a time that feels terribly remote; the beautiful moments that stand out are few and far between. I confess to doing a lot of skimming.

The Oxford Annotated Bible, the edition of the Good Book that I'm reading, explains in its introduction to the New Testament that "a more appropriate word than 'testament' to designate the character of these books is 'covenant,'" since what is new is specifically the agreement that God makes with his people. As described in the prophecy of Jeremiah, the nature of this shift is from the laying down of the law to the laying upon of hands, from a learning from without to an awareness from within — from a presence among the Chosen People to the essence within every person.

As I read the first book of Luke, the only Gospel that contains the beautiful story of the Annunciation, I tried to imagine Mary as a good Jewish girl, demure, literate, and ready to go with the flow with the predictions of angels. It's a strange sort of literary Gedankenexperiment, but it feels appropriate to my own situation, as I attempt to recast myself in my own story — by going back to school to study, at last, my first passion: writing.

### Celebrations
Last weekend I went to a wedding between two young and beautiful people (the bride is a family friend whose birth I am old enough to recall). It was the first trip to the Hamptons on Long Island for both my parents and myself, where we managed to continue an unfortunate family tradition of ending up (at least the first night) in miserable accommodations. (The last time this happened, at my cousin's wedding in London, we actually moved hotels; this time we merely moved rooms.) Anyway, the overall trip was lovely, and the wedding was spectacular: beautiful setting, poignant ceremony, plenty to drink, wonderful food, and — best of all — great music and dancing.

Men aren't commonly taught to partner dance these days, and my father probably only learned because he grew up ice skating, and his years on the rink included a period of dancing, often with his mother as his partner. It'd been years since my father and I had danced together, and for legitimate reasons, I'd thought my father's dancing days were behind him. And yet he was in great form that night, and we cut a rug together, enjoying equally the dancing and the amazement that, after everything that has happened in the last few years, we _could_ dance.

Over a decade ago, the father of the bride suffered a massive heart attack, and in the subsequent trauma, suffered significant brain damage and memory loss. Physically, he recovered, but emotionally, psychologically, and intellectually, he was (and is) no longer the same person. It was a tragedy, and yet his wife's commitment never wavered, and she never let the new challenges of their life stop her from living. She retired as planned, and the two of them travel frequently. The result of too much pre-dinner liquor, I asked her through tears how she had done it, telling her how much I had always admired her. She smiled and said that she didn't know; all she knew was that he was her husband, and that you don't always get everything you want in life. And while that is most certainly true, and while most of us muster the perseverance to survive, fewer are blessed by the grace of acceptance, by which I mean the deep knowledge that, truly, things could not have been any different. It was this grace that the mother's inability to explain 'how' exuded; watching the bride boogie with her father to the song I knew she had played constantly as she waited for him to come out of his coma, I felt confident that this grace was upon her daughter as well.

### Believe in... yourself
The four people who read this blog know that I usually write about politics. Part of me really wanted to write about how outraged I was about what Romney said last week on 60 Minutes when asked about the problem of the uninsured in America. Instead of taking credit for the ahead-of-the-curve solution he helped engineer in Massachusetts, Romney rambled off the pathetic fact that, if you go to an emergency room in this country, no one is turned away because of the lack of an inability to pay.

I could go on and on about how stupid and insensitive this remark is — and how it was this exact problem that motivated the solution-oriented Governor himself to favor, once upon a time, the personal mandate — which is, as well all know, at the heart of what we now call RomneyCare. I could analyze that remark as revealing Romney's deep down disdain for people who don't make enough money not to need insurance — we are freeloaders who want handouts, and so what more could we want than to go to the emergency room when we are desperate and not have to pay a dime!

I have grown to genuinely dislike Mitt Romney over the past few months, although I'll be content to forget about both him and my animus as soon as it is confirmed that he will indeed not win the presidential race. My fear about a Romney victory has lately given way to a bit of schadenfreude regarding his campaign. Mitt really sucks at running for office, and when the guy who sucks is on the other team, one can get a little glib about it.

Romney suffers from a common bewilderment that besets an overall successful person when he tries to do something he's simply terrible at. Romney, by all accounts, is an affable, compassionate, and intelligent guy. The guy you'd want making the presentation or closing the deal when it comes to business. He's smart, polished, unfailingly polite. He has a record of success (in business, in church, in family life), and probably believes that he should be good at whatever he sets out to do.

A different man probably would have quit by now, but it's important to remember that Romney's faith in himself echoes his Mormon faith — his conviction doesn't waver no matter how unconvincing his pitch proves to others. (In France, on his Mormon mission, Romney apparently didn't convert a single person.) Indeed, as we can see from the latest real Romney secret video moment, Mitt doesn't even want to try to convince those who aren't wealthy enough to be motivated by lower federal tax rates to vote for him.

This rare kind of conviction — half justified self-esteem, half well-practiced blind faith — is probably as good as explanation as any as to why Romney can essentially reverse his position on any given issue and still believe that he, well, believes anything at all. Heck, [if God can change his mind about black people](http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=160879686) [follow the link and search for "Before we go any further", then read from there] certainly Romney can change his mind about a personal mandate and gay rights, no?

After all, he's a Mormon, and dang it, a Mormon just believes.
