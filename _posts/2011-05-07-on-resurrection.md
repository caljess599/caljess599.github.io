At the heart of the liturgical calendar is the notion that, in the year-to-year routine of our lives, we are better served by the celebration of a season, a course of days or weeks, than that of a single day. Certainly a particular day can hold special significance, but the calendar design suggests that we should contemplate and experience the major commemorative events for more than a mere 24 hours.

Last weekend I went to my first funeral. That I have made it this long without such an event is due only partially to familial longevity -- the other reason is that my father's relatives have chosen to donate their bodies to science, and parties were held instead of funerals. Memorial parties, of course, but it is hardly the same thing.

The pastor who led the service told us that the Easter season was the ideal season in which to celebrate Wendy's life, for Easter commemorates the resurrection of Christ, and thus the promise of eternal life after worldly death for all of us. While I have no memory of ever discussing God or religion with Wendy, it so happens that I have been reading the works of the Christian theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, so I am better informed about the significance of Jesus in Christianity than at any previous point in my life.

Resurrection, however, remains a tough nut. Somehow, the question of origin seems easier to answer than the question of destination. Biological life, by its very definition, must have both beginning and end, but the miraculousness of birth, the beginning, is somehow more accessible. Even the notion of Christ's incarnation, or in general the idea of the Divine taking human form, is easier to parse than the notion of human death, or the necessity that the same Divine form rise again after dying a human death. The resurrection is the greatest promise wrapped inside the greatest mystery.

Metaphorically, on the other hand, resurrection is quite easy to understand. Life is made of days but also seasons, and in some of them we fall, and hurt, and must lay fallow and rest, recover. Succor and help and rest give us new energy, new chances, new life. Death, in this metaphor, stands for crisis, a breaking point, a breaking down of the old out of which can arise the truly new. Sometimes there is no way to go forward without first going back, going down, going away for a while.

The key is in this "while." Anything that you can come back from can be thought of as a blessing; no where more evident, at least for me, is the meaning of the Divine than in the witnessing of possibility, the reversal of our circumstances and attitudes. That which holds the place of what is, to you, impossible, and shows you, gradually, its possibility, is the Divine. It is what exists even when you do not see it, sustaining you, never separate from you, even in your deepest suffering.

What greater gift is there to be brought out of suffering, into the promise of a better time? This is the gift of crisis. Crisis is indeed, as an old saying goes, danger plus opportunity. And certain opportunities cannot be granted without that danger.

Wendy had a difficult life, the last thirteen years of which she spent courageously waltzing with the cancer that eventually took her off the mortal dance floor. Wendy was special, though, in that she was a woman who never expected things to be easy. She was understated, unfazed, unflappable. With the same keen calmness with which she accepted life's trials, she made things wonderful (as in, full of wonder) in every arena -- in the homes she made her own, in the simply gourmet meals she generously prepared for family and friends, in her teaching and scholarly work. Everyone who met her delighted in her, whether for her wit, her warmth, her intelligence, or all of the above. And never has there been someone so well-loved who spent less time currying favor. She was simply herself by virtue of not thinking too terribly much about herself.

And now she rests.
