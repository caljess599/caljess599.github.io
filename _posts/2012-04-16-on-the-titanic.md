title: On the Titanic
---

<blockquote>God moved out on the water
On April the 14th day
God moved out on the water
Everybody had to run and pray

Many hearts surrender
On the sea, on the sea
Many hearts surrender
Singing 'Nearer My God to Thee'</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">--A <em>Titanic</em> song (lyrics recalled from memory)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today is the 100th anniversary of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>'s departure from Southampton, and the fascination with the grandeur of the ship and the grimness of the tragedy with which its name is now synonymous remain undiminished.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><!--more-->The <em>Titanic</em> disaster, although a century past, belongs in many ways to our modern age: the sinking of the unsinkable ship captures both the optimism of our technological hubris and the humility of our resignation to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today is also the day that Rick Santorum <a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2012/04/10/us/politics/100000001481150/rick-santorum-suspends-his-campaign.html" target="_blank">announced the suspension of his presidential campaign</a>. Considering that this moment was both inevitable and incredibly overdue, the timing of this announcement was better managed than much of the campaign that preceded it: his daughter Bella is out of the hospital, and the Pennsylvania primary is still a respectable fortnight away. He can put family first as well as avoid what would have been a needless exercise in humiliation -- (another, if you count 2006) repudiation by his 'home' state voters. (The Santorums actually live in Virginia now.)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/opinion/sunday/a-quantum-theory-of-mitt-romney.html" target="_blank">recent tongue-in-check opinion piece</a>, David Javerbaum profiles Mitt Romney as the first quantum politician -- a politician whose qualities follow the beguiling rules of quantum physics, such as complementarity, uncertainty, and entanglement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While this seems like a too-interesting-by-half explanation for a too-uninspiring-by-far candidate (Romney's been running for president <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_by_time_in_office" target="_blank">longer than a bunch of presidents have served in office</a>), it does indeed seem that we are at a point in this country where, to understand it, you must, to a new and unprecedented degree, be capable of entertaining contradictory ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm not talking about routine differences of opinion on economic policies. Consider the question of unemployment insurance: you will find those who consider it an essential safety net, and those who believe that it provides an incentive for workers to remain unemployed. And, despite the struggles of millions of jobless Americans, we can more or less calmly have this discussion. (Anyone remember Occupy Wall Street? Didn't think so.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm talking about a different kind of debate. Rick Santorum wants all children conceived -- regardless of the circumstances under which they were conceived, their parents' willingness or ability to provide for them, or their medical prognosis -- to be carried to term and lovingly provided for. He wears his heart on his sleeve for a daughter whose life he feels is more threatened by its diminishment by others than it is by her genetic disorder.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">America is a place where both Santorum's view <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/opinion/sunday/having-an-abortion-when-no-one-called-me-a-slut.html" target="_blank">and its opposite</a></em> feel logical, humane, and right. So it is safe to say that it is impossible to decide these questions as a nation. Actually, it is impossible even to <em>ask </em>them, given that entire nations don't have babies -- individuals do. These issues are rarely, if ever, settled satisfactorily by laws -- a fact that, sadly, has rarely stopped legislatures from trying, then or now.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One hundred years ago, the world was stratified and unfair, and its highest and lowest sailed out together on the <em>Titanic</em> to meet their terrible, cold doom. The world is different now, surely, but it is still stratified and unfair, and, now as then, the poor get the worst of it when disaster strikes. And yet no one would propose legislating against shipwrecks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And yet that, I say, is the legacy of the quixotic Santorum campaign, the candidate who would turn grief into legislation, his own private tragedy into public policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tragedy, properly understood, is not something against which one crusades -- or campaigns. It is the realization that you don't get to make the world after your own ideas, no matter who you are and what you believe -- even if, so many times, it seems as if you have done just that successfully.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <em>Titanic</em> reminds us that no matter how big a ship you build, the ocean can take it and hide it and, eventually, dissolve it forever.</p>
