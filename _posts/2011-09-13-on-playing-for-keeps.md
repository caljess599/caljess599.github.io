It is commonly said that "the past catches up with you," but in my own life, anyway, I have often found that I am the one doing the catching up; I believe I am moving away from the old, only to find myself unexpectedly face to face with forgotten ideas and endeavors.

This accidental return describes the way in which I came to "specialize" in Italian theater during my doctoral studies. Looking back, I can plot the trajectory of how my first love, theater, and I became separated. At the time, however, it seemed like some sort of cosmic accident that after six years of graduate school, I was searching for the plays that would form the core of my dissertation.

There is something incredibly satisfying about the dimensions and directness of a play, the way it takes dialogue and confrontation for granted, even demands it. Certainly many curtains have fallen on the dead, the distraught, and the despairing, but even the saddest of dÃ©nouements nonetheless fulfills the need to have things out that life itself often denies us. Certainly, moving on is the trendy attitude of the empowered and savvy, who break up via SMS, but there is beauty in the brilliant articulation of full-fledged crisis, in the moment-by-moment turning of lives in the time of the breath, the time of the word.

And sometimes, there are happy endings.

### È più capriccio che un dramma
The French film _Va savoir_ (2001) is about love, theater, and the love of Italian theater. Camille Renard is the lead actress in an Italian theater troupe, headed by her partner Ugo Bassani. Troubles surface from the start: Camille is troubled by memories of her ex-boyfriend Pierre, whom she left when she left Paris three years before, and Ugo is distressed at the growing financial straits of the company, made increasingly dire with low advance sales for the Paris run.

Camille's own return to the scene of her past, one that still haunts her, is magnified by the play the troupe is performing, Luigi Pirandello's _Come tu mi vuoi_ (which is most typically translated as _As you desire me_, but _As you like me_ would be just as accurate, plus providing a charming echo of Shakespeare). In this play, Pirandello tackles several of his favorite themes: the subjectivity of truth and the impermanence and instability of identity. Camille's character, L'Ignota, the Unknown, is a woman who may or may not be the long-lost wife of Bruno, but she is willing to follow Boffi (Bruno's advance man, played by Ugo) back to the Veneto from Berlin, where she lives a dissolute life, despite the objections of Salter, the psychologist who has fallen in love with her and taken her in. She desires to be just a body, and let Bruno reanimate her, according to his memories, according to his vision—as he would wish her to be.

The film deftly weaves together snips of the performances and off-stage action, giving us a streamlined version of Pirandello's play along with Camille's exploration of her own past. She cannot resist going to Pierre's apartment, where she used to live with him, only to meet his new financée, Sophie, there. She does however find him in the park, sitting on the same bench reading the same paper (Die Welt) as he used to each morning. Only the title of his dissertation has changed, having been shortened to simply "Heidegger, le jaloux." (All you non-academics, trust me that this is a big deal.)

Meanwhile, Ugo is mining a different kind of past, the literary one, looking for an unpublished play of Carlo Goldoni, one he reportedly wrote as a gift for a friend who helped him out financially. His search takes him to the Vernet collection, presently in the possession of the first wife of one of Vernet's great-grandchildren. Thus the film's cast of characters expands to include Marie-Pierre's two children: the parasitical, thieving Arthur from her first marriage, and the beautiful, resourceful Dominique (Do) from her second.

### Il n'y a rien de tragique, tu sais, je t'assure
Camille does not feel free of Pierre after their brief but inconsequential encounter. She writes him and explains that she will leave two tickets for him and Sophie for the show the following night. He comes, but alone, after which they walk, and talk, and he invites her and Ugo to dinner. Remarkably, an appearance of normality seems established between the ex-lovers.

But things are not as they seem, neither for Camille or for Ugo. Dominique assists him with the search for the manuscript within the collection, but leads him to understand that all is not as it seems... strange things, she says, happen "dans cette maison, dans cette pièce," which means "in this house, in this room,"—except that the word _pièce_ in French can mean also "play" or "furniture" (among several other uses). It is perhaps the ultimate word to describe something that is contained, or arranged, or placed, and all of its senses are certainly being invoked in this film, and in the play at its heart.

Arthur is not only revealed to be the purloiner of an occasional manuscript, and strangely close to his half-sister, but also a seducer of women, including, we soon see, Sophie. The crisscrossing between the six characters is complete when, after the disastrous dinner between the two couples, Camille goes to visit Sophie at the dance studio where she teaches ballet, and there runs into Arthur. In addition to the various personal motives pulling these characters together, the play itself serves as a center point, as all of them go to see it at one point. (Do even goes twice, first with and then without her mother.)

As Dominique falls in love with Ugo, Camille seems unable to resist further involvement with Pierre. Though embarrassed by Ugo's behavior at the dinner, she seems equally disturbed by Pierre's increasing effusiveness toward her. If perhaps she was not sure at the beginning whether she was over him or not, when she goes to see him, she explains in no uncertain terms that she has moved on, that she loves what she does and whom she does it with. But Pierre believes her actions more than her words, and in an unexpected turn reveals that, in his opinion, nothing has changed, and nothing will—he has been waiting for her for three years, and this time he intends to keep her. And he shuts her into a small room in his apartment and leaves.

Calmly, Camille escapes via the roof, and rushes back to the theater with just enough time before the show, apologizing for her lateness but also letting off steam, remarking that it was hardly as if she'd died.

### È finita la commedia
It is to the death, however, the duel to which Ugo challenges Pierre—the place being the catwalk above the theater's stage, and the weapon being bottles of vodka. The two men will drink, and the first to fall loses. This challenge is a lovely take on Pirandello's own more serious commentary on the dangerous practice of duels in another one of his plays, _Giuoco delle parti_, managing (as does the entire film, really) to embrace all the seriousness and sadness of Pirandello's ideas within the hopefulness of a modern comedy—safety net included.

Happiness prevails all around, as all the main characters end up together on the theater's stage for the movie's finale. What has been lost or obscured is recovered, but the weight of the past is removed. Camille takes advantage of Arthur's (genuine?) obsession with her—brought on by her beauty and her portrayal of the Unknown woman, with whom he identifies—in order to beat the con man at his own game, using the pretext of a one night stand to steal back the valuable ring he had stolen from Sophie. The ring itself, with the inscription "Time flies, love remains," is a reminder of Sophie's own past as the girlfriend of a thief and her ten months in prison. Yet when Camille presents Sophie with the ring, she tells her to keep it, having firmly committed herself to her future with Pierre, to whom she is devoted despite his obvious eccentricities.

Even Do's hurt at Ugo's gentle rejection of her gives way to glee as she realizes the old book her mother pulls off the cookbook shelf is indeed the Goldoni play,_ Il festino_—not destino—_veneziano_. With the swap of one letter, the strangely un-Goldonian sentiment resolves into his familiar comedic spirit. During the finale, Do presents the manuscript to a drunken Ugo, who can hardly believe it. He warns her again that if she lets him stage it, its value as an unpublished manuscript will disappear, but she encourages him, telling him if he stages it, she will come to watch. (Although one wonders if this dream will come to pass, given that Arthur is sitting right near them, likely overhearing this discussion.) The half-siblings thus continue as before, dancing together as the truly odd couple they are.

At last, then, Ugo and Camille are reunited, her romantic past behind him, his search for his elusive Goldoni ended. Not only has the strain between them disappeared, but Sophie's gift of the valuable ring to Camille has saved the troupe. She will go with him after all not just to Vienna (the tour's next city), but "to the end of the world."

Rideau.
