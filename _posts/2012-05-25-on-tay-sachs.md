<blockquote>If it's one thing I hate more than prophesy, it's self-fulfilling prophesy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My biggest concern is that my kids are going to come home from high school and say: The world is warming up. We're too industrialized. We drive too many cars. We have too many people. And human nature is polluting the world.</blockquote>

<h3>End Times</h3>
Religion, if considered merely as dogma, is easy to poke fun at. Such a skewering has the uncomfortable reductiveness of -- pardon the expression -- preaching to the converted. Those who already roll their eyes at 'religious people' raging against homosexuals, or defending biblical cosmology, or being suckered by slick televangelists of all sorts -- they will be happy enough to watch this documentary for the laughs (and there are some good ones). However, Maher's overt disdain toward defenders of dogma is unlikely to allow his larger point to reach a wide audience. And yes, he has a point: if we don't get our act together, we are going to cause an environmental and/or political apocalypse.

<!--more-->Maher is not wrong in his identification of religious belief as an obstacle toward consensus around many urgent environmental issues. If you treat the Bible as a source of scientific information, then you aren't going to be impressed by the 'evidence' of scientific cosmology. If you believe that the world is destined to be destroyed, well, you aren't likely to be too concerned by the secular predictions of doomsday in the form of environmental catastrophes. But it would be reductive to claim that everyone who rejects the science on climate change does so out of religious faith; to do so would be to confuse the specific freedom of religion with a broader right to skepticism about anything, for no reason other than one's personal feeling. As the all-too-honest quote of Renee Domico illustrates, her objection to the teaching of climate change is rooted in much more visceral place than the defense of the Bible: she simply just doesn't want to hear that her family and her lifestyle are destructive. And frankly, who would?

Pier Paolo Pasolini, best known for his films, but also an accomplished novelist, poet, playwright, and essayist, understood the Catch-22 of good things (such as having children) colliding with circumstances that rendered them no longer unequivocally good. In writing in regard to the referendum to legalize of abortion in Italy in 1975, Pasolini emphasized that the proper context for the question was wider than political ideology.
<blockquote>The context in which abortion should be considered is an ecological one: it is the demographic tragedy, that, on an ecological horizon, presents itself as the most serious threat to the survival of humanity. <em>[...]</em> In the past, the couple was blessed, today it is cursed. <em>[...]</em> And so also with weddings: at one time they were celebrations... Now instead they all seem like grey and hurried funeral rites. The reason for these terrible things I am saying is clear: at one time the "species" had to fight to survive, therefore births "had to" be greater than deaths. Today on the contrary the "species," if it wants to survive, must find a way that births are not greater than deaths. Thus, at one time, each baby that was born, being a guarantee of life, was blessed: each baby that is born today, on the contrary, is a contribution to the self-destruction of humanity, and is thus cursed. We are thus arrived at the paradox that what was once said to be against nature is natural, and that what was once said to be natural is against nature.</blockquote>
Pasolini's specific point about the alterable relationship between 'nature' and the 'natural' is the now-precarious denigration of homosexual sex, which has been condemned as 'unnatural' precisely because of its 'non-reproductive' nature. In today's context of marriage equality, where gays and lesbians are (or will be, eventually) granted the same right to marry on the basis that the nature and possible goals of their unions are no different from those of different-sex couples, Pasolini's argument about the beneficial status of homosexual (non-procreative) sex seems fairly arcane. Yet Pasolini's concept of wrongful birth is still alive and well, albeit not in the ecological context of reproductivity, but within the related domain of 'productivity'.
<h3>Wrongful Birth</h3>

<blockquote>It's a pro-life bill on every account, yes. It sends the message that all life is worth protecting, is worth living, whether you are born with a disability or not.</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">--Nancy Barto, Arizona State Senator</p>
Recently, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/15/152687638/should-parents-be-able-to-sue-for-wrongful-birth" target="_blank">wrongful birth made the news</a>, as several state legislatures debate laws that would prevent couples from suing a doctor who fails to warn them about fetal problems.

The legal concepts of wrongful birth and wrongful life <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/12/style/courts-weigh-value-of-unwanted-lives.html" target="_blank">are not new</a>. Wrongful birth suits are brought by parents when a child -- often disabled but sometimes healthy -- is born as the result of medical negligence, such as a failed vasectomy or tubal ligation, whereas wrongful life suits are brought on behalf of a disabled child, whose life, it is argued, is wrongful and would not exist were it not for medical negligence. Accordingly, the damages for wrongful birth are based on the parents' lifespans, while in wrongful life they are assessed in terms of the child's life expectancy.

The overlap of this issue with the pro-life cause is obvious, as such lawsuits assert after birth what is often asserted before birth through the choice to terminate a pregnancy: preference that the child not have been born.

The link between this preference and 'disabilities' is an especially sensitive topic. The issue is further clouded by the grouping together of a child born with a severe defect (say, spina bifida) or terminal disease (say, Tay-Sachs) and a child born with a disability that does not threaten the fact of her life but rather the much more subjective issue of its quality.

While a lawsuit in which parents declare that they would have preferred that their child not have been born cannot help but seem in some respect repugnant, the idea that there is something immoral about regret is wrongheaded. There is no moral imperative that someone be happy about the cards she is dealt by fortune, and if parents choose to rail against misfortune in the form of a lawsuit, that is hardly a moral failing. Nor does minimizing the hardships entailed by the birth of a disabled child constitute a claim to a moral high ground.

It seems that the better our technology is at seeing into the womb, the more we look through a glass darkly. Faith, be it in the great powers of medicine or in the mysterious ways of God, is not a guarantee of outcomes, but merely a safe harbor for our spirits, buffeted by the seas of ever-uncertain circumstances. When one could know nothing of a child's health before she entered the world, there could be no standoff between the hang-wringing of denial ("This shouldn't happen!) and the applause of endorsement ("This should happen!"). Life, in all its vagaries, simply came, and was received with the deference appropriately accorded to the inevitable.

<blockquote>Never to have lived is best, ancient writers say;
Never to have drawn the breath of life,
never to have looked into the eye of day;
The second best's a gay goodnight and quickly turn away.</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: right;">--Sharon Hoffman, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/15/152687638/should-parents-be-able-to-sue-for-wrongful-birth" target="_blank">on her son with Tay-Sachs disease</a></p>
Of all the benefits of modern medicine, none seems so comforting as those that promote and protect the health of newborns, and the mothers who bear them. (Although <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/magazine/ina-may-gaskin-and-the-battle-for-at-home-births.html">the role of hospital birth</a> in this project continues to be debated.) Surely the death of a child, though all too common throughout history, goes against our sense of the natural order of things, by which parents raise children, who grow into adults and in turn nurse their parents in old age.

Again, then, we are confronted with the conflict between nature and our sense of the natural, a conflict that no advances in medicine, pre- or post-natal, will ever resolve. To dwell with humility in this chasm between what we would wish and what is, neither unduly eschewing nor enshrining it: that is the ultimate grace.

This is the grace described by Emily Rapp, who, despite several pre-natal tests, nevertheless bore a son with Tay-Sachs. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/opinion/sunday/notes-from-a-dragon-mom.html" target="_blank">an opinion piece for the New York Times</a>, she describes the terribly unique experience of parenting a terminally ill child.
<blockquote>Ronan won't prosper or succeed in the way we have come to understand this term in our culture; he will never walk or say "Mama," and I will never be a tiger mom. The mothers and fathers of terminally ill children are something else entirely. Our goals are simple and terrible: to help our children live with minimal discomfort and maximum dignity. We will not launch our children into a bright and promising future, but see them into early graves.</blockquote>
Rapp is also the author of a memoir in which she describes her struggles due to a congenital condition which left her, from childhood, reliant on a prosthetic leg. She makes no mention of her own disability in the piece about her son, which is only appropriate, for it has no bearing thereon.

The distance between these two texts, and the two experiences they describe, is not just that of time. In her memoir, Rapp describes a struggle to love herself, one that in her experience is fundamentally linked to her disability, but is entirely recognizable to others who have faced that same challenge, even without additional physical obstacles. In contrast, Rapp's meditation on her son's sad fate is a story of a different struggle, that to love freely under the constraints of tragic circumstances. The former is a story of evolution and overcoming; the latter a tale of devolution and acquiescence.

Both, however, came out of the same hope, and must therefore be honored. This call to honor is not a plea to our moral nature, but rather to that of our wondrous one. For it is wonder that is the only sure antidote to the condition of uncertainty that governs our mortal existence.
