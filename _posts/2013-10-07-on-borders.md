> So what I finally decided was, art is simply inevitable. It was on the wall of a cave in France 30,000 years ago, and it's because we are a species that's driven by narrative. [...] Art is also about problem solving, and it's obvious from the news, we have a little bit of a problem with problem solving. In my experience, the main obstacle to problem solving is an entrenched ideology. The great thing about making a movie or a piece of art is that that never comes into play. All the ideas are on the table. All the ideas and everything is open for discussion, and it turns out everybody succeeds by submitting to what the thing needs to be. Art, in my view, is a very elegant problem-solving model.

### Castles in the Sky
Recently, I had a chance to visit one only two remaining Baroque theaters in the world; apparently, remodeling and/or fire have destroyed the rest. The one I visited is in the tiny Southern Bohemian city of Český Krumlov, part of the immense castle complex first constructed before 1250. Over the course many owners, the castle was expanded and refurbished: most notably, it was the Rosenberg family who, over the course of three centuries (1302-1602), expanded and beautified the castle, including the expansion and painting of the characteristic tower in the 1581 and 1590 respectively.

The Baroque theater dates from much later owners; from 1765-1766, Josef Adam zu Schwarzenberg remodeled the existing theater building (built nearly 100 years prior) and transformed it into a state-of-the-art facility for the staging of Baroque operas. The period embraced excess and ornamentation to a combination and degree perhaps not seen since; in opera, this translated to lengthy spectacles in which no effort was spared to manufacture—through the use of complex stage mechanisms (trap doors, flying machines, instant before-your-eyes scene changes) and sound effects, in addition to the music itself—an ideal environment for the spectator to succumb to the illusion of the drama.

For twenty years, Josef Adam brought a troupe of actors, musicians and their trappings to mount a summer season of operas and plays for the entertainment of the palace dwellers and their guests. (The theater was not heated, so could not be used in the winter.) But his son didn't share the father's interest in theater, and so the theater (and the adjoining building where the sets, costumes, props and scores were kept) was simply shut up and forgotten about. It sat there, safe but ignored, slowly rotting away, until the mid-1960s, when excavation and restoration of this unique place began. Today, you can sit in the orchestra and look at the restored theater in low lights as well as visit the area underneath the stage where the beams and ropes that made the magic happen—and still do so during the limited season of operatic performances the theater hosts. The only concessions to modernization have been in the use of electric lighting in the theater itself (although the orchestra pit still uses candles during performances) and the installation of a tile floor under the stage--before it was merely dirt. Eventually, depending on the progress of restoration (which itself depends on money), the repository of costumes, props, sets and documentation will also be fully restored and opened to the public as a museum.

From the point of view of preserving history, the benign neglect of this theater has proven to be a tremendous gift. But as its rarity testifies, historically there was little interest in preserving products of cultural ephemera, including opera. Although it may come as a surprise to some, students of opera know that the concept of a repertory in which the works of the past were preserved and revived is shockingly recent. This is why we have many, many librettos from the 17th and 18th and even the 19th century without scores—the librettos were suitable for reuse, while the music was considered disposable. While analog and now ubiquitous digital recording have taken the notion of preservability to the opposite extreme (we are more likely to worry about how to preserve it than the value of doing so, which is almost taken for granted), the Lesson of the Rare Baroque Theater pinpoints rather elegantly the orthogonal relationship between art making and keeping art: there may be old and new for the maker, but it is only history that confers upon the past the notion of 'authenticity'. To repeat, it is not a matter of whether the past is acknowledged, for no artists works in a vacuum of the present. Rather, the difference is the way in which the past is acknowledged: incorporation versus isolation, evolution versus preservation. Put plainly, it is the difference between a theater and a Baroque theater.

As rare a site as the theater is, it did not appear to be a top tourist destination at the ÄŒeskÃ½ Krumlov Castle. (There were maybe 8 people on our English-speaking tour.) The tower, on the other hand, had plenty of visitors, despite the fact that the neatest thing about the beautiful structure painted to look like a multi-colored extravaganza of sculpted stone is not to be _in_it but to look _at_ it from further away. If this view in previous centuries served as a kind of billboard for the Rosenberg family's power, now the onlooker is more likely to appreciate the construction itself, perhaps without even pausing to consider that the many artisans who designed and built it were responsible not to beauty but to the demands of their employers. Or perhaps it is precisely this fortuitous outcome between the expression of wealth and that of beauty that makes this quaint town, completely modernized in every other respect, worthy of its place on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites. Surely it is not the power dynamics that are strange to us, as the industries that exist to fulfill the unique needs of the rich continue to thrive, but rather the fact that beauty visible to all used to be the (occasional) result of these whims.

### Crossings
Apparently we got lucky on our trek between Germany and the Czech Republic (which also took us through a slice of Austria on the way back), as we were later informed that each country requires visiting cars to purchase a unique highway sticker that allows you to travel its high speed roads. One might forgive a traveler without good (or any, in the case of Czech) knowledge of the native language for thinking that the days of such border-based worries were over; the only person to welcome us to the Czech Republic when we crossed the border was our English-speaking GPS.

As any student of history knows, however, the borderlands between Southern Bohemia and Upper Austria saw a great deal of conflict in the last century. As an outsider visiting in the age of the EU, driving almost without awareness over national borders, staring at the rolling fields of farmland on all sides, you are hard-pressed to roll back the clock to the Cold War and the hot one before it; it was over these lands that Hitler ordered his armies while the world stood by, still clinging to the vain hope of appeasement.

Conceiving of the region that spans Southern Bohemia and Upper Austria as a unified space, despite multiple languages and national territories, is one way that enlightened folks have been striving to find aspects that united rather than divide the region's inhabitants. While we were in ÄŒeskÃ½ Krumlov, the former synagogue (itself used as a chapel for the liberating GIs at the end of the war) hosted an exhibit that formed part of the first ever "Landesausstellung," (Land Exhibition), a venture of exhibits in four towns in this region, two in Upper Austria and two in the Czech Republic.

Late one night in ÄŒeskÃ½ Krumlov, I read about the [death of Garry Davis](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/us/garry-davis-man-of-no-nation-dies-at-91.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0), a man who in 1948 renounced his United States citizenship in order to declare himself a citizen of the world. While the notion of World Government almost inevitably sounds dystopic to our cynical ears, Davis viewed global unity as essential not for what it could create, but for what it could dissolve: nation-states, and with them, all need for war. Whether utopian or quixotic—the press and public were divided—Davis was certainly committed, and spent half a century traveling with the first passport (no. 1) issued by the organization he founded, the World Government of World Citizens, sometimes charming or wearing down foreign passport authorities, but very often being detained and deported. (Somehow or other, though, he was able to settle down in his later years in Vermont.)

The inspiration of this odd life came in a B-17 bomber over Germany, where Davis's conscience asked him if there were another way besides the "murder" of "men, women and children" in which he was participating. It is not surprising that in the context of such a nationalist, territory-focused conflict that this other way would be the elimination of these very bodies. While shaky as a political strategy, as a formulation of the human right not to be blown to bits while going about your daily business, it is a clarion call. After all, the reason Davis was in that plane, and the reason he was dropping bombs, was because he was "American" and they were "German," and the two countries were enemies. In Davis's mind, the elimination of this difference went to the heart of eliminating the possibility for such large-scale conflict, and the suffering and destruction it brought.

### Wanderers
While the threat of total war waged by an expansionist regime is seldom on anyone's mind today, Davis's insistence on the inalienable right of anyone to travel anywhere is a topic as timely as they come: while Julian Assange and Edward J. Snowden choose first-world-style vagabondage to avoid facing the music in their respective home states, the coffins keep filling this week on the Italian island of Lampedusa as divers recover more bodies belonging to the men, women and even children who were [shipwrecked in their attempt to reach European soil](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24418779) last week. As the influx of immigrants (both legal and illegal) continues, nationalist political parties in many European countries incite followers with racist, anti-immigration rhetoric—and all this at the same time when some political theorists believe that the only way for Europe to survive (economically but also politically) is to [acknowledge the increasing irrelevance of its internal nation-state borders](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/opinion/the-fix-for-europe-people-power.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0).

While the elimination of frequent passport controls and currencies exchanges have changed the flavor of multi-country European travel, and while globalization has made the selection of shops far more uniform (think H&M and Starbucks) than ever before, these changes, in my experience anyway, only seem to highlight the remaining unique features of each country: language, architecture, customs, cuisine. In an age of instant, cheap, and frequent communications, there is something downright magical about arriving at another latitude and longitude and finding oneself, in the midst of an ever-increasingly linked infrastructure, in a space colored by a different language and culture.

It is easy to become cynical about the level of uniformity among people on the street, wearing the products of the global clothing trade and staring into the same smart phones. But we have to ask ourselves if we were really convinced that national borders really made people fundamentally different from one another, and if the similarities wrought by today's particular consumerism aren't just the form in which the revelation of our fundamental human sameness takes in this age (religion no longer serving this purpose, although the churches remain). We might bear in mind that unity, whether understood in the context of peacenik pluralism of Garry Davis or the perverted purity of neo-Nazism and other fundamentalist movements (political and religious), has always been and remains a seductive promise for crusaders of all stripes.

Whatever the anxieties, individual and collective, about the changing face of Europe, the ball is rolling downhill. Europe, through legal immigration, has already significantly loosened the ties, imaginative and legal, between 'nationality' and 'country of birth'. This idea that you can be say, German, even if your parents are from Pakistan, is a concept taken for granted in America, but one that has just begun to take hold in the European cultural imagination. But the tide has turned in a way from which there is no turning back, given declining birthrates, the demand for labor from abroad, and non-isolationist policies fundamental to the ideals of Western democracies.

Countries, as living products of human culture, are like theaters; they evolve to survive. To fixate on an idea of Europe, or of static, inviolable individual nationalities within its borders, is to pretend that a country can be like the Baroque Theater in ÄŒeskÃ½ Krumlov: a relic of a place popular for a brief while and then abandoned, now admired by a mere handful of visitors and scholars for its historical value and 'authenticity'.

From the looks of things, closing Europe for business and reopening as a museum doesn't seem likely. You can admire the past all you want, but you can't live in it.
