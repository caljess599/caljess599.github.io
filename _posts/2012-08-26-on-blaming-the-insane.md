title: On Blaming the Insane
---

> That James Holmes is insane, few may doubt. Our gun laws are also insane, but many refuse to make the connection. The United States is one of few developed nations that accepts the notion of firearms in public hands. In theory, the citizenry needs to defend itself. Not a single person at the Aurora, Colo., theater shot back, but the theory will still be defended. —Roger Ebert, "We've Seen This Movie Before"

> Particularly instructive is the moral prohibition of violence in our society. (By "violence" I mean physical attacks on human beings or the application of physical force to human beings.) Several hundred years ago, violence per se was not considered immoral in European society. In fact, under suitable conditions, it was admired. The most prestigious social class was the nobility, which was then a warrior caste. Even on the eve of the Industrial Revolution violence was not regarded as the greatest of all evils, and certain other values—personal liberty for example—were felt to be more important than the avoidance of violence. [...] As the Industrial Revolution progressed, the powerful classes, perceiving that violence was increasingly contrary to their interest, changed their attitude toward it. [...] \[T\]hey gradually transformed the attitude of the entire society...  Today the media, the schools, and all who are committed to the system brainwash us to believe that violence is the one thing above all others that we must never commit. (Of course, when the system finds it convenient to use violence -- via the police or the military -- for its own purposes, it can always find an excuse for doing so.) —Theodore J. Kaczynski,
"Morality and Revolution," in _Technological Slavery_ (241-42)

Early last Friday morning, a 24-year-old man named James Holmes walked into a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, threw canisters of some breath-complicating gas, and opened fire on the audience that had come out to watch the lastest Batman move, _The Dark Night Rises_. As of XXX, the death toll is 12, but 11 of the nearly 60 people injured are in serious condition.

The reaction to yet another random shooting in a public venue in suburban American has been greeted with the by-now-familiar mix of shock, grief,  general head-shaking and hand-wringing. The President flew back from the campaign trail to Washington so he could play the consoler-in-chief; perhaps stating the obvious (life is precious, uncertain) looks more presidential than stumping against Richie Rich Romney? Personally, I'd rather have better gun control than the President's heartfelt prayers, but at this point I'm resigned to getting only the former in this country, from a leader of either party.

I do not believe I'm exaggerating when I claim that it could have been all the children of every member of Congress in that theater, and still no one would be calling for a ban on the sale of the weapons whose power we glorify (precisely in films like _The Dark Knight Rises_) but whose consequences we mourn as if a shooting was an act of God as unpreventable as a tornado. Rather, the right will call for all of us to arm ourselves for protection, and the left will wax philosophical about cherishing the moments between the gunshots. (Thank you, [Mayor Bloomberg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Zhvk6A3kE), for actually demanding more than platitudes.)

And, to add insult to all the injuries past, present, and future, everyone will blame the insane. We know shockingly little about James Holmes, a graduate student at the University of Colorado, Denver, who had reportedly been in the process of withdrawing from the neuroscience program there. But already people who had never heard his name before he was arrested in the darkness of the cinema parking lot feel quite comfortable dismissing him as insane.

As inevitably happens in these sorts of incidents, he will be dismissed as disturbed, insane, etc., and his actions will be assigned to his mental problems, rather than to the availability of automatic weapons. Normal civilians, you see, don't use guns for the purposes they were intended for -- and anyone who does use them to kill random people is, by this tautology, not a normal person.

The familiar call to get better background checks to prevent "people with a history of mental illness" from purchasing firearms is  While most mentally ill people are not violent, and while most crimes are committed by the sane, we go out of our way to absolve social circumstances and assign heinous crimes to individual defect. This is of course to be expected in a country obsessed with the notion of personal responsibility, but this argument is predicated on an outrageously false supposed connection between violence and mental illness.
