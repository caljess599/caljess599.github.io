title: On Company
---

No man is an island. We are engineered, by need and desire, to be around others. This need is not necessarily identical to the desire for specific relationships, for ties that bind. Company is not identical to companionship. While companionship (in all its forms, from workout buddy to friend to lover to spouse) is about relationships, company is a practice, a social phenomenon often off our radar screens most of the time. In this day of social networking, we are often more focused on who we know, who we are connected to, than who we are around.

Company is all about being around others, without necessarily connecting with them. Travelers, or people who have recently moved, are perhaps best poised to recognize the need for company, the benefits of feeling surrounded by people, even if the people are (forever or for now) strangers. Before the crowds of city life dominated the human experience, getting a lot of people together for a celebration was arguably as much about the getting together itself as it was the observance's ostensible purpose.

These days, most people are more apt to resent the forced company of others (crowded trains, buses and planes) than they are to rejoice in the opportunities for cursory social interaction. And yet haven't we all met at least one interesting person on a cross-country flight, whom we enjoyed getting to know, even if we never spoke again?

This is the pleasure of company.
