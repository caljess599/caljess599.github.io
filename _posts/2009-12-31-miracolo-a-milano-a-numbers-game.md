title: "Miracolo a Milano: a numbers game"

The miracles of *Miracolo a Milano* (1951) are multiple, and they multiply.

The first miracle is the making of a mother out of a poor old woman named Lolotta who finds a baby in her cabbage patch. With obvious joy, she raises her son Totò, educating him with the basic skills she feels important; in particular, she drills hims on his multiplication tables. <!--more--> Left alone upon her death, Totò is sent to an orphanage, from which he emerges with none of the spiritual scars one might anticipate from such an upbringing. His first encounter, immediately upon his emancipation, he tells a man "Buongiorno" but is only answered by suspicion: "What do you mean by 'Buongiorno,'" the stranger asks, hostile. Totò il buono cannot convince him that he means simply what he says.

After enters the world of dispossessed and destitute milanesi after following a mendicant who steals his small valise (containing his few worldly possessions). The man is intensely ashamed when Totò confronts him, explaining humbly that he simply liked the case. Totò simply removes his stuff and gives it to the man. When Totò asks about where he can go to get a room, the man offers to let Totò pass that night at his place--which is, we soon discover, nothing but a small cardboard box in a desolate field on the city's outskirts. Totò is home.

Through spirit and force of personality, Totò leads an initiative to turn organize the homeless community into a spiffy shantytown. As his mother did before him, he worries about the kids learning their numbers, and decides that he will rename the streets after pieces of the multiplication table: Strada Maggiore becomes Strada 5 x 5 = 25 (Strada cinque per cinque fa venticinque), etc., etc. At least this way, Totò is confident, the children will learn something useful.

The innocence of numbers is soon intruded upon the by bigger numbers of capitalism. Oil is discovered on the land, which leads to the new owner's decision to chase the beggars off the parcel. Additionally, Lolotta descends from heaven to give Totò a magic dove (which she is not allowed to take out of heaven) that can render real any desire Toto asks of it, whether it is the production of two fried eggs on the spot, or the transformation of the policemen ordered to lead the eviction brigage into opera singers incapable of shouting "charge!". 

Once the immediate threat of eviction is avoided, the beggars become enthralled by the powers of the dove, and Totò satisfies their every wish, from material goods (clothes, furniture, etc.) to the removal of physical afflictions (the short man is made taller, the man who stutters has his stutter removed). Even one man's fantastic desire to make the mannequin in the town square come to life is indulged. 

And yet the beggars who shortly before had nothing are nearly instantly consumed the an insatiable desire for more, a process that reaches its climax when a beggar asks for money, which prompts another one to ask for more money, until the series of millioni di millioni di millioni is implicitly infinite. Here the numbers return, no longer symbols of life's practical knowledge, engrained within the modest streets of a shantytown, but rather representing the dooming endlessness of infinite (and unspecified) desire. 

Distracted by their new passion of consumption, the beggars are eventually rounded up into paddywagons and taken away (a fate not preventable by Totò, as two angels keep descending to take the dove back to heaven). 

In the film's final moments, however, Lolotta manages to give the bird back to her son one final time to allow him to free the beggars and fly them toward heaven on the brooms of street sweepers. They are going to a place where the reign of infinite numbers and consumption does not exist; they are going to the place where "buongiorno really means 'buongiorno'."
