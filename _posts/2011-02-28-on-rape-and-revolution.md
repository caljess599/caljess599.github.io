title: On Rape and Revolution

Like many, I have been riveted by the recent upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. The crises faced by many governments in the region truly epitomize the saying that crisis equals danger plus opportunity. For those who have no or little freedom of expression, or no or little say in how they are governed, the overthrow or ouster of their oppressors represents the ultimate opportunity, based on the greatest human hope, namely, that one can have autonomy over one's own life.

<!--more-->Even in the midst of the peace and unity of Tahrir Square, however, acts of rage and frustration reveal the darker side of any revolution. Some people feel the need to express violently the shame and frustration that are more often than not the byproducts of oppression. Very often, men who feel these emotions vent them on women. <a href="http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/02/lara_logan_raped_egypt_reporte.php" target="_blank">The assault of Lara Logan in Tahrir Square</a> is an example that made headlines, but beyond the headlines, women in Egypt endure routine sexual harassment, generally verbal, from men when they are in public. Listen to the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/world/jan-june11/egyptwomen_02-21.html" target="_blank">PBS NewHour discussion</a>.

This sad event is not the only tie-in between the treatment of women -- specifically the maltreatment of women -- and revolution. The raped woman has historically served as a poignant metaphor for an oppressed country. Just last week, Roberto Benigni made reference to Italy as "un corpo dilaniato, posseduto, stuprato, violentato, saccheggiato, il corpo piÃ¹ bello del mondo... saccheggiato, proprio per quello" in his beautiful exegesis of the Italian national anthem. That is, "a body torn apart, possessed, assaulted, raped, sacked, the most beautiful body in the world... sacked precisely because of [its beauty]." While the world <em>corpo</em> is masculine, it is obvious to all that this is the beautiful body of the woman <em>Italia</em>. (<em>La patria</em>, the fatherland, is feminine in Italian.)

The spark that lit these revolutionary fires also is connected to the performance of female victimhood.  As has been widely reported, what triggered the initial uprising in Tunisia was the self-immolation of a 26-yr.-old fruit seller named Mohammed Bouazizi. The setting of oneself on fire is a gruesome act, and is not particularly culturally intelligible in the West. (Here's a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043123,00.html" target="_blank">history in TIME</a> magazine.) But just months ago the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/world/asia/08burn.html" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> ran a story</a> on this practice among Afghan women. Here is the first paragraph:
<blockquote>Even the poorest families in Afghanistan have matches and cooking fuel. The combination usually sustains life. But it also can be the makings of a horrifying escape: from poverty, from forced marriages, from the abuse and despondency that can be the fate of Afghan women.</blockquote>
Although Tunisia is not Afganistan, and the gasoline Bouazizi used is not cooking oil, the frustration and desperation he felt by being denied even the right to make a meager living as a fruit seller seems a fair enough comparison to the subjugation of a Afghan bride. The comparison gets even more interesting if we consider the following detail from the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/02/20/60minutes/main20033404.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody" target="_blank">60 Minutes story on Bouazizi:</a>
<blockquote>A municipal official, a woman, came by and confiscated his scale. It was worth $100 and Bouazizi knew he'd have to pay a bribe to get it back. This had happened to him before. But this time, he got mad. He complained and the woman slapped him. One slap in the face, and that's how the revolution began.</blockquote>
While we cannot know that things would have gone differently had it been a man to take away his scale, or a man to slap him, we do know that his act of self-immolation gripped the imaginations of his fellow-country men.
<blockquote>"The symbol by just burning himself, using his body as a way to express that anger and need for dignity touched a lot of Tunisians," Zied Mhirsi told "60 Minutes" correspondent Bob Simon.

Mhirsi is a doctor and radio show host who was active in the uprising. He worked with us on our story.

"Do you think this revolution would have happened now if it hadn't been for Bouazizi?" Simon asked.

"I don't think so," Mhirsi replied, shaking his head.</blockquote>
Indeed, Bouazizi's act prompted not only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/world/africa/18egypt.html" target="_blank">other self-immolations</a>, but also protests, which eventually swelled and spread, giving us the smorgasbord of (relatively) peaceful change (Egypt) and violent unrest (Libya) we see before us today. Bouazizi's act epitomized a powerlessness infused with action, with resolve, even if that resolve was self-destructive. This powerlessness clearly resonated with his compatriots, and went on to capture the imagination of frustrated citizens all over the region.

And this is where the analogy with the Afghan women ends. Bouazizi's act did not confirm his position of powerlessness in a culture that condoned it and that was designed to perpetuate it. Rather, it provoked the majority in agreement with Bouazizi to act against the government whose policies wanted to deny him (and many like him) a living. And so his act galvanized them, forced them to look at and acknowledge their own humiliation and take action. It was not an escape, it was a call to arms.

In this sense, shame is a critical component to these revolutions. While I would never excuse those who raped Lara Logan in Tahrir Square, it is rule of thumb that people excise their own sense of powerlessness by finding someone else to hold power over. And you cannot cry out for freedom without the acknowledgement that you have been -- and for a very long time, in many of these countries -- kept down. Sadly, many people cannot rid themselves of the embarrassment of what they have endured, so patiently and so silently, without transferring your status of victim to someone still less powerful than yourself. In this way, Lara Logan, a female reporter with great deal of autonomy and fame (including a lot of talk about her sex life), symbolized the power that her attackers wanted and had felt denied by their own governments. In short, they turned their symbolic, feminized subjugation around by physically violating an actual woman. Even in the 21st century, this oldest of tropes is still played out every day. We would be naive to think it is not so.

Let us hope that the new governments that are formed in the Middle East and North Africa empower all citizens in such a way to promote the equal rights of women. Despite the documented inequalities that still exist within the United States between men and women, particularly in salary and in employment opportunities, when compared with the status quo in many, many other places, (most) women in this country are extremely blessed.

Certainly I feel ambivalent about wanting to thank the men of the United States who treat women with respect -- it feels odd to express gratitude for the granting of a basic human right. Except that this is how all human rights are granted, by each individual human granting them to other human beings.

Meanwhile, sex and revolution continue arm in arm. You tell me what the dancers flanking Qaddafi are there for in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBY-0n4esNY" target="_blank">this YouTube mash-up of the mad leader's speech</a>, which will certainly go even more viral than it already has, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/world/middleeast/28youtube.html?_r=1&amp;hp" target="_blank">thanks to the <em>NY Times</em></a>.
