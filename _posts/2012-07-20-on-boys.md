> For anyone that has carried their son's or daughter's coffin, it's unnatural. A child who loses a parent becomes an orphan. If a man and wife lose each other, they become widow or widower. It's so unnatural, there isn't even a word for families who lose a child.
#### —[Ciaran Staunton](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/opinion/sunday/dowd-the-boy-who-wanted-to-fly.html), father of 12-year-old [Rory Staunton](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/nyregion/in-rory-stauntons-fight-for-his-life-signs-that-went-unheeded.html)

### Grounded
For better or worse, a parent who loses a child remains a parent. In his grief, Mr. Staunton can be forgiven for forgetting that losing one or more children before adulthood used to be an all too natural part of parenting. It is only [in the last century](http://www.hrsa.gov/healthit/images/mchb_child_mortality_pub.pdf), with its plummeting rates of infant and child mortality, that we have come to conceptualize as an aberration what historically was taken for granted.

One wonders how grief, like many other emotions, might be shaped by social and historical circumstances: might the normality of the death of a child in previous times have eased the solitude of such sadness? Might this <!--more-->widespread understanding have taken away the extra sting of incomprehensibility out of the unavoidable, shattering sense of loss?

Reading the [critical account of the medical decisions](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/nyregion/in-rory-stauntons-fight-for-his-life-signs-that-went-unheeded.html) in the final days of Rory's life, one cannot help but be struck by our steadfast belief in modern medicine: no longer do we view one's survival as a turn of simple good luck; instead, we view death as the result of unfortunate decisions and missed opportunities. In short, we believe that as long as we act appropriately, we can usually prevent death.

When someone young dies, there is always an additional sense of regret for the end of a life that barely had a chance to get off the ground. This metaphor is especially relevant for Rory, who wanted to become a pilot. With timely instruction and training, he might not have been all that far from realizing his dream. It may surprise you to know that many states allow kids to earn a pilot's licence before they are old enough to drive—Rory found a flight school that accepted students as young as twelve so he could take a flight with an instructor upon what would be his last birthday.

There is something incredibly beautiful about being able to learn as a pre-teen something most of consider too complicated or dangerous to attempt at any age. Flying, despite the commonness (and entirely eroded glamour) of its commercial version, still manages to represent the wonder and daring of youth, the pursuit of the carefree through dedicated practice and application of skill. It captures perhaps like nothing else the blend of childish wonder and almost-adult seriousness, a combination Rory's very physique—already five-foot-nine and 169 pounds—seemed to embody.

### Growing pains
Recently, David Brooks took [one of his columns](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/opinion/honor-code.html)to discuss the social dangers of not letting boys be boys. By now, he points out, the evidence that [boys overall are lagging behind girls](http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Adrift-Epidemic-Unmotivated-Underachieving/dp/0465072100) is incontrovertible: boys' test scores in reading and writing are far lower than those of girls; the historic advantage they have enjoyed in math and science is almost gone. Boys account for far more discipline problems, and they earn 75% of high school Ds and Fs. Colleges scramble to find enough young men in a more or less hopeless quest to un-skew their gender ratios.

If you were thinking this general male failure to launch has helped women, you'd be wrong. If anything, it has just made the competition among the most educated and motivated of them all the more fierce -- while as a group they still bump up against the same glass ceiling in the spheres of business, government, and academia. Meanwhile, for the average, non-Ivy-League-aspiring woman, the lagging performance of men overall constitutes a different kind of burden: it becomes more and more difficult for them to find marriageable men, a fact that has been blamed for the [startling increase in single motherhood in the last several decades](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/us/two-classes-in-america-divided-by-i-do.html). In short, the collapse of widespread male success is bad for everyone.

While Brooks paints boys as the victims of schools' rigid expectations that every student be "nurturing, collaborative, disciplined, neat, studious, industrious and ambitious," boys are  also the target of a much more serious form of abuse. Besides the ongoing revelations about pedophile priests, we have just witnessed the trial of Jerry Sandusky, who was [convicted of sexually assaulting 10 boys](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/sports/ncaafootball/jerry-sandusky-convicted-of-sexually-abusing-boys.html). (In all, the jury found him guilty on 45 of the 48 counts in the indictment.) 

In a way, though, the deluded Sandusky (listen to the way he talks about his feelings about boys in [this surreal interview with Bob Costas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xy0L8MUsOE), right after the scandal broke) is just the tip of the iceberg of a larger crime, namely the willingness demonstrated by many (assumedly non-pedophiles) in positions of power [to look the other way](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/12/sports/ncaafootball/13pennstate-document.html) in order to perserve their own positions in the exploitation ring for fame and profit known as college football. Penn State will likely get a slap on the wrist when they deserve to have the book hurled at them, i.e., [a multi-year suspension of the football program](http://www.npr.org/2012/07/16/156855045/op-ed-ban-penn-state-football).

While we may all agree that a grown man raping a boy in a locker room shower is wrong (even if some of us are not willing to act to stop it), it seems that we are stuck when it comes to acknowledging the issue of homosexuality as part of a frank, unprejudiced upbringing in modern society. While you can now be a gay Marine, good luck being a Boy Scout who is struggling with nascent same-sex attraction. After a secretive two-year review, the [private association has decided to retain its policy](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/us/boy-scouts-reaffirm-ban-on-gay-members.html) against any member (Scout or Scout Leader) who is openly gay. While such a policy is fully within the association's constitutional rights, it seems like a giant step backward for the raising of boys -- yet another insistance that they learn to conform, rather than to honestly embrace who they and their peers really are. In the case of the Scouts, rather than the school system, it is the Mormon and Roman Catholic Churches (both large financial supporters of the Boy Scouts) who are attempting to pigeonhole boys into what they find acceptable.

### To write a boy
A classic piece of advice given to writers is "write what you know." Lately, I have realized how much I am drawn to writing about what remains a mystery to me, sensing that imagination will give me a different but equally important form of understanding.

I was teaching a 3-year-old friend of mine about imagination the other day. Julian (not his real name) is the oldest son of a good friend of mine, and I have known him long enough now to see him go from uttering a few garbled words to carrying on earnest conversations. I was telling him how while the world of things has rules (those of parents as well as those of physics), anything is possible in the world contained within one's mind.

Being friends with a young child is mostly about being delighted. Surely that's the purpose of many friendships and romances, but the role of pure enjoyment of the other takes on an added emphasis when you rule out many mainstays of adult conversation: the past, the future, work woes, relationship drama.

Predictably, most of our conversations revolve around the pure joy of learning about the wonderful world of things. Julian already knows the names of more types of lawn and construction equipment than I do, but luckily the farming magazine we are looking at has all sorts of wonders in it (although honestly the mower ads are Julian's favorite). I tell him about honey, and why the beekeeper who harvests it from the bees has to wear the white suit and a big helmet over his face. We look at fabulous photos of rare kinds of broccoli, and I realize that the world is not new all the time just for three-year-olds, but for me, too.

Julian will likely never remember any of these early times, but it is not any less wonderful or deep of a process for that fact. I have seen him go from shy to gregarious with me, from upset that I take his father away from him to make music to able to wait fairly patiently until we are done so we can "hang out" and "have a chat." I have watched the hints of his character—smart, curious, willful, excited, helpful, non-covetous—come gradually into sharper relief.

Such is the magic and mystery of boyness, happening right before my eyes.
