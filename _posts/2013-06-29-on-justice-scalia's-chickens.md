title: On Justice Scalia's Chickens
---

> One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is "an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres." Ante, at 14. It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed.  Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as "discrimination" which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously "mainstream"; that in most States what the Court calls "discrimination" against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such "discrimination" under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress, see Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1994, S. 2238, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994); Civil Rights Amendments, H. R. 5452, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975); that in some cases such "discrimination" is <em>mandated</em> by federal statute, see 10 U. S. C. §654(b)(1) (mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such "discrimination" is a constitutional right, see Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640 (2000). 

#### —Justice Scalia's dissent in [_Lawrence v. Texas_](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284) 

### Discrimination my ass!
This week, when the [Supreme Court ruled](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf) that section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, Justice Scalia's chickens came home to roost, prompting the same displeasure as they had as hatchlings a decade earlier, when the Supreme Court overturned Texas's sodomy law on the grounds that it violated the Due Process Clause.

Due Process, a notion that originates in the Fourteenth Amendment, is designed to make sure that the law is applied equally to groups similarly circumstanced, i.e., that it does not "discriminate" in the pejorative sense. (Most laws are a matter of discrimination in the literal sense—they apply to one group and not another; 12-year-olds can't legally drive, but that doesn't violate Due Process).

In cases where the Due Process clause in invoked, there are several legal levels of scrutiny, meaning, there are different standards a given statute has to meet to satisfy Equal Protection requirements, depending what the law regards. Under the highest level of scrutiny, [strict scrutiny](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/epcscrutiny.htm), "the government must show that the challenged classification serves a compelling state interest and that the classification is necessary to serve that interest." Strict scrutiny only applies, however, when the classification used in the law is "suspect" (i.e., race, national origin, religion, or alienage) or it (the classification) burdens fundamental rights, including (but not limited to) the right to vote, the right to interstate migration, and access to the courts.

In the _Lawrence_ decision, Scalia opined that the only way to overturn _Bower_, the precedent that held a Georgia sodomy statute constitutional, is to find that the Texas statute failed the rational basis test (the lowest level of scrutiny) or—in order to hold the law to a higher level of scrutiny—find that the right to sodomy is a fundamental right. And yet, much to Scalia's consternation, the majority in _Lawrence_ did neither: it explicitly acknowledged that it was "quite unwilling" to "announce... a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy" and it also applied what Scalia called "an unheard-of form of rational-basis review that will have far-reaching implications beyond this case."

This unheard-of form of rational-basis review is the notion that, as found by the _Lawrence_ Court, laws that accord with the moral opinion of the majority are not justifiable by any state interest.

> The Texas statute undeniably seeks to further the belief of its citizens that certain forms of sexual behavior are "immoral and unacceptable," [_Bowers, supra_,at 196](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14901730125647575103&amp;q=lawrence+sodomy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003)—the same interest furthered by criminal laws against fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity. _Bowers_ held that this _was_ a legitimate state interest. The Court today reaches the opposite conclusion. The Texas statute, it says, "furthers _no legitimate state interest_ which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual," _ante_, at 578 (emphasis added). The Court embraces instead Justice Stevens' declaration in his _Bowers_ dissent, that "'the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice,'" _ante_, at 577. This effectively decrees the end of all morals legislation. If, as the Court asserts, the promotion of majoritarian sexual morality is not even a _legitimate_ state interest, none of the above-mentioned laws can survive rational-basis review. [_599_](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284)


Scalia sees the sky about to fall, and, apparently the sky has fallen, now that the demise of DOMA has put the inevitability of mandated legalized gay marriage—the liberal majority's intent all along, much to Scalia's ire—even closer. In his dissent in _Windsor_, the Justice boldly accuses the majority of writing the decision with the further goal of finding a fundamental constitutional right to gay marriage, and, using the _Lawrence_ decision for leverage, overturning any and all state statutes restricting marriage to heterosexual couples.

Scalia demonstrates what he sees as this unforgivable judicial activism by quoting sections of the majority opinion and simply changing the relevant wording. Here's one example:

> "~DOMA's~ _This state law's_ principal effect is to identify a subset of ~state-sanctioned marriages~ _constitutionally protected sexual relationships_, see _Lawrence_, and make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency. Responsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person. And ~DOMA~ _this state law_ contrives to deprive some couples ~married under the laws of their State~ _enjoying constitutionally protected sexual relationships_, but not other couples, of both rights and responsibilities." [_23_](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf)

<p style="text-align: left;">Scalia sees the same judicial overreach here he saw in <em>Lawrence, </em>and just as he didn't believe the majority's assurance in 2003 that that decision did not have implications for gay marriage statutes, he counts as an outright misrepresentation the penultimate claim in <i>Windsor</i> that "[t]his opinion and its holding are confined" to those couples "joined in same-sex marriages made lawful by the State" <em>(</em>26, 25).</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the Court declared a constitutional right to homosexual sodomy, we were assured that the case had nothing, nothing at all to do with "whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter." <em>Id.</em>, at 578. Now we are told that DOMA is invalid because it "demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects," <em>ante</em>, at 23—with an accompanying citation of Lawrence. It takes real cheek for today's majority to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitutional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex marriage is not at issue here—when what has preceded that assurance is a lecture on how superior the majority's moral judgment in favor of same-sex marriage is to the Congress's hateful moral judgment against it. I promise you this: The only thing that will "confine" the Court's holding is its sense of what it can get away with. <em>(22)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Just(ice) You Wait!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I actually believe Scalia when he says has nothing against homosexuals. But having nothing against them does not imply that he is at all moved to grant them legal rights that a state or federal legislature is not prepared to grant. He is simply obsessed with this  notion of majority rule, believing that it is far more honorable to "let the People decide," even if this results in women being denied abortions in entire swaths of the country and even if this means that gay couples never come to share the federal benefits of marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is a purity of process to this fundamentalism of Scalia's, but it is but shallow comfort if you wish you could marry your same-sex partner, or if you need an abortion and have no means to travel to a far-off state where it remains legal. I doubt Scalia would have such respect for majority opinion if its results interfered with something he really considered fundamental to his own well-being and self-determination (or, one might add, his own political sympathies, Ã  la <em>Bush v. Gore),</em> regardless of whether it happened to coincide with the rights enumerated in the Constitution. He's just lucky, perhaps, that his interests happened to great-great-grandfathered in. Nor do I see what is so noble about his 'too bad' stance for the rest of us, either; are we supposed to feel grateful for the Court's restraint <em>on principle, </em>consoling ourselves that, although we are subject to the legislative vagaries of abortion-restricting-obsessed or homophobic right-wingers elected in hopelessly gerrymandered districts, at least there isn't one High Court arbitrarily making law? Sorry, Scalia, but one look at what Texas has managed to do to women's rights over the last several decades is enough to destroy that We the People fantasy for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I read a book recently that glorified this same attitude of Scalia, John Taylor Gatto's <em>Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling</em>, a series of rather compelling essays (mostly) about the failures of public education in America. In a late chapter, though, Gatto zooms out a bit to discuss the notion of local control (the solution to our educational morass, in Gatto's mind) in a larger contest. Using the example of the evolution of the restrictive Congregational communities of Colonial Massachusetts into the most liberal state in the nation, Gatto credits the "self-correction" process of "unconditional local choice." These elite, dogmatic communities that had expelled members of all other religious denominations gradually (i.e., over several centuries) turned tolerant of their own accord, not by having any policies mandated by outside authority. Gatto heralds that process as superior to the gains of twentieth-century progressivism:</p>

<blockquote>Think of the great progressive victories won in the courts because social engineers were unable to build popular consensus, or were unwilling to wait: affirmative action, desegregation, restrictions on graphic sexual imagery available at the local newsstand, various women's rights issues, and so on. Are these victories for the groups the courts sough to protect, or do these victories hold the same value they would have, had they been won through change in the social consensus? <em>(83)</em></blockquote>
While even <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/03/11/130311fa_fact_toobin" target="_blank">Ruth Bader Ginsburg has questioned the political wisdom of <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a> (having herself pursued an incremental approach as a women's-rights lawyer), Gatto and Scalia are obsessed by the character of social struggle to the point where they seem indifferent to the relief accorded and the lives changed via judicial means. Scalia writes:
<blockquote>In the majority's telling, this story is black-and-white: Hate your neighbor or come along with us. The truth is more complicated. [...] We might have covered ourselves with honor
today, by promising all sides of this debate that it was theirs to settle and that we would respect their resolution. We might have let the People decide.

But that the majority will not do. Some will rejoice in today's decision, and some will despair at it; that is the nature of a controversy that matters so much to so many. But the Court has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat. We owed both of them better.</blockquote>
While it is easy to agree that in theory that it does no good to change people's minds by force (legislative or otherwise), I doubt blacks in the Jim Crow South would have welcomed another 50 to 100 years of segregation in order to let people change their minds on their own (never mind the previous question of slavery!), much as I am sure that women in Texas are not going to be consoled by the possibility that, one day in the future, their legislators may discover more pressing matters than closing health clinics that (as part of their services) provide abortions.

Yours is lovely ideal, Justice Scalia, but the timeframe of an ideal is ill-fitted to a human lifespan, and the pace of society's natural betterment often too sluggish for those who find themselves on the unfortunate side of the majority's moral opprobrium.

<em>and that in some cases such "discrimination" is a constitutional right, see Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640 (2000).</em>
<p style="text-align: right;">and on May 23, 2013, <a href="http://www.scouting.org/sitecore/content/MembershipStandards.aspx" target="_blank">61% of 1,232 voting members of the Boy Scouts of America</a>
approved a resolution stating that youth may not be denied membership
in the BSA on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone
(the policy will take effect Jan 1, 2014).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As outraged as Scalia is at what he perceives as the Court's single-minded mission to carve out rights for gays and lesbians, thus ignoring the legislative process, there is no doubt that this process is also alive and well—We the People is coming around to gay rights. And so it is disingenuous to assume that any prescience by the Court on what history surely will bear out—namely, that gay marriage helps many and harms none—constitutes <em>a priori</em> some sort of judicial tragedy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In his statement upon the announcement of decision, Rex Tillerson, past president of the Boy Scouts of America, noted the following about organizational change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is also very normal for a lot of people to feel like there were winners and there were losers. Well I'm here to tell you that's not true—in any circumstance like this. And I've seen it, over and over. I understand people that feel like there are winners and losers, but the reality is that there are neither winners nor losers.  What is left after we make the decision to change is the mission, and the mission has not changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tillerson goes on to describe the traditional activities of scouting that will soon take place as the summer season begins in order to highlight the fact that the vast majority of scouting will not change—and is not being asked to change, as everyone in the organization wants the camping and learning to continue. It is too easy, he remarks, to be overwhelmed by what is changing, and in so doing, forget the knowns of the mission. "The main thing," he reminds his audience in closing, "is to serve more youth."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although Scalia loathes what he feels as the Courts interference in a process of change the Framers reserved for the legislative branch, this sentiment still applies. The mission of government is to serve the people that constitute it, and that has not changed. In his blind deference to the notion of majority rule, Scalia has confused himself as to the purpose of government, which is not the passive activity of moral judgment, but the action of service.</p>
