title: On Newness and Loss
---

At least for a certain swath of American society, there is a strong association between a new beginning and the accumulation of new things; multiple rituals of arrival, whether that of a new baby or going off to college, are strongly associated with collecting, whether this collecting occurs via receiving gifts, hand-me-downs, shopping, or some combination thereof.

Less obvious is the association of loss with newness. Indeed, in major life-changing situations, such as having a child or arriving at college, one is perhaps less likely to reflect on what has been left behind--the thrills and trials of one's new life leave little room for such ruminations. The new taxes our brains, demands more energy, more focus. There is so much to think about, our brains respond by demanding more processing time, i.e., more sleep.

The brain works hard to adjust to the new. And yet loss is there, too, in the midst of this newness. When we move, or change jobs, we must establish new patterns, and in so doing, we are forced to surrender the old ones. Some of us thrive on changing things up constantly, but most of us adjust only gradually, and with effort. It is often inevitable that we compare our old routines with our new ones, lamenting new inconveniences even in the best of circumstances. We carry our old things with us--perhaps losing things along the way--and try to put them into new places.

We are creatures of habit, and there is a cultural tendency to prize consistency and longevity in our endeavors, be it in our number of years of service to an institution or in the length of our marriages. And yet in a world where frequent moves and career changes is becoming the norm, we must learn to discern and appreciate a continuity of a different sort, namely of undergoing such changes with a lasting grace. It is not where we arrive, but how we arrive, that counts.
